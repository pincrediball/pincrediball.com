<p>Yesterday I did the first bits of drag action.
Today dropping stuff in the right places has been implemented.
There&#39;s a <em>metric</em> ton of things left to smooth out, but let&#39;s start with the good parts.
Here&#39;s what you can currently do:</p>
<video controls loop>
  <source src="/img/pincrediball-v1-20230321-drag-and-drop-basics.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Video recording showing drag and drop of Pinball machine components
</video>

<p><em>Super</em> clunky, but you might get the basic idea?</p>
<h3 id="day-37-dropping-the-beat--checklist">Checklist</h3><p>So we achieved quite a bit today:</p>
<ul>
<li>✔ Dragging &quot;new&quot; components from the toolbox on the left to the playing field</li>
<li>✔ Dragging &quot;existing&quot; components on the playfield around</li>
<li>✔ Crude animation (green flashing area) of the valid drop area</li>
<li>✔ Fallback for when trying to drop outside the valid area</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to some other unrelated improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>✔ Music and SFX toggle buttons</li>
<li>✔ Run Playbook option will now reset the balls</li>
<li>✔ Official &quot;Stress Test&quot; option to fire off 10 balls</li>
<li>✔ Score reset when running playbooks</li>
<li>✔ Score disabled during a &quot;Stress Test&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>But there&#39;s a ton left that&#39;s not (yet) working surrounding Drag &amp; Drop functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>❌ Rotating certain components (bumper pills and wall corners) is missing</li>
<li>❌ Toolbox items should be usable only the allotted number of times, not infinitely</li>
<li>❌ You should <em>not</em> be able to move items during a play run</li>
<li>❌ Each Playbook should get a maximum number of seconds of runtime</li>
<li>❌ A &quot;Stop Playbook&quot; option is needed</li>
<li>❌ The &quot;Toolbox&quot; looks ugly and cramped, the layout needs work</li>
</ul>
<p>And given the late hour when I write this probably a few more things.</p>
<h3 id="day-37-dropping-the-beat--kowalski-analysis">Kowalski, analysis!</h3><p>The situation is... <del>grim</del> <del>dire</del> <del>ugly</del> <del>promising</del>... frustrating?
Godot and game development are a struggle (for a web developer by trade).
Around every corner there&#39;s a new gotcha waiting, it seems.
Perhaps my expectation of picking it up quickly given software development skills in other areas was unrealistic?</p>
<p>Either way I&#39;m proud to be pressing on.
And proudly press on, I shall!
The quality might not be where I want it to be, but my <a href="#day-29-planning--goals">goals</a> I <em>will</em> reach!</p>
<p>Onward.</p>

<p><strong>Yikes!</strong>
Only two weeks left to finish my <a href="#day-29-planning--goals">goals</a>.
I&#39;ve nicely stuck to the plan, and worked on Drag &amp; Drop of Pinball components today.
Which brings me to say...</p>
<p><strong>Whelp!</strong>
Doing drag and drop in Godot is not easy <del>at all</del>.
The very first steps are trivial.
Many tutorials describe how it&#39;s done.
But the edges... are rough.
And when I get distracted, I get <em>distracted</em>;
and I&#39;ll write an entire sample of <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/jeroenheijmans/sample-godot-drag-drop-from-control-to-node2d'>how Drag &amp; Drop could be done</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>.
Guess I&#39;d summarize it with a...</p>
<p><strong>Grumble!</strong>
A <em>satisfied</em> &quot;grumble&quot; though, because I worked hard, I made progress, and learned new things.
But a &quot;grumble&quot; nonetheless, because tomorrow will be another full day of dragging this feature along.
Let&#39;s hope I&#39;ll get it done with one more day.
Or at the very least have fun while trying!</p>

<p>Although there&#39;s plenty of visual changes, today it&#39;s worth viewing progress with sound turned on (I muted it by default):</p>

<p>Are these the best sound effects and bits of background music in the world?
No.
But it&#39;s <em>something</em> and that&#39;s where we&#39;ve got to start!</p>
<p>Some other changes, next to music and sound:</p>
<ul>
<li>The &quot;Playbook&quot; top left is now &quot;real&quot; and connected;</li>
<li>The &quot;Run Playbook&quot; button will reset score and flippers;</li>
<li>The &quot;Your Score&quot; part has been better aligned with &quot;Score Targets&quot;;</li>
<li>Basics for level medals and level progression are in place.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="day-33-sounds-good--alpha-release-then">Alpha release then?</h3><p>So one notable thing is <em>still</em> missing: <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/orgs/pincrediball/projects/1/views/1'>Drag &amp; Drop</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>.
Which actually is the core of the inner game loop.
Together with a few other bits it&#39;s the last thing missing for the alpha release.
Here&#39;s a snapshot of <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/orgs/pincrediball/projects/1/views/1'>the Kanban Board</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>:</p>

<p>I&#39;m a bit sad that I didn&#39;t fully finish the alpha release this week.
If I&#39;d pushed a bit harder this week, or would work a bunch over the weekend, I&#39;d be able to finish it.</p>
<p>But I won&#39;t.
It&#39;s a hobby- and vacation project.
It&#39;s meant to be fun.
And there&#39;s plenty of time left.
So I&#39;m off for the weekend, and will continue on Monday where I left off.</p>
<p>See you then!?</p>

<p>We&#39;re steadily approaching a state where I&#39;m ready to let some initial testers handle it.
This version of the game will be equivalent to what you get at the end of a &quot;Design Sprint&quot;.
It requires a test script and an interviewer (to explain what&#39;s <em>not</em> finished and testable yet).
But still: a milestone!</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what currently happens when you play the game:</p>
<video controls loop>
  <source src="/img/pincrediball-v1-20230316-playbook-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Video recording the Tutorial Pinball Machine, with playbook features
</video>

<p>Notably the <strong>drag and drop features are missing</strong> so you can&#39;t actually <em>play</em> the game yet.
That will be <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/orgs/pincrediball/projects/1/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=22796854'>the main issue</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a> to tackle tomorrow!
With some further tweaks to some components, physics, and <em>maybe</em> placeholder sound effects, we should close in on the alpha release.
Nice!</p>
<p>Now excuse me while I run off to play some Lego Star Wars or Cascadia, and recharge for the last day of this week tomorrow.</p>
<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></article>
          <hr class="my-8 border-t border-t-amber-400/25"><article id="post-2023-03-15" class="scroll-mt-24 prose prose-invert max-w-none"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><h2 id="day-31-mixed-feelings">Day 31: Mixed feelings</h2><p><strong><em>Jeroen</em>, March 15, 2023</strong></p>
<p>I feel good about today&#39;s progress.
And I feel pretty salty about today&#39;s progress.
Mixed feelings, I&#39;d say.</p>
<h3 id="day-31-mixed-feelings--salty">Salty</h3><p>Building the foundations for the final app I encountered a super weird bug.
The ball would sometimes just jump off on its own.
And sometimes it would &quot;sink&quot; into a platform.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what it the bug looks like (with some slow motion):</p>
<p><a href="/img/pincrediball-v1-20230315-physics-bugs.gif"><img src="/img/pincrediball-v1-20230315-physics-bugs.gif" alt="animation of ball jumping up on its own"></a></p>
<p>After <em>hours</em> of reading documentation, bisecting code, and debugging, I found the issue:
<strong>the texts and white rectangle to the <em>left</em> of the machine can <em>sometimes</em> cause the ball inside the machine to jump about</strong>.
Absolutely nuts!</p>
<p>So I felt pretty unhappy about lost time.
But Annoyance made room for feeling relieved when I found a good minimal way to reproduce it.</p>
<p>Yet I was soon back to being even more salty again.
Here&#39;s how.
I wrote <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/jeroenheijmans/repro-godot-bounce-bug'>a good reproducible scenario</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a> and <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/74940'>GitHub issue for Godot</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>
A super short summary of the repro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a specific (valid!) Node Tree</li>
<li>The tree involves combining GUI and Node2D nodes with physics</li>
<li>The presence of a white rectangle (!) next to the physics node, can affect if the physics <em>inside</em> that node in weird ways</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I was informed in a one-sentence reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think this is not a bug, but <strong>user error</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ahh, the good old &quot;<em>stupid user</em>&quot; excuse.
Because the wording straight up <em>blames</em> the user for their problems.
<em>They</em> are in error.
This probably makes me extra salty because I&#39;ve used that excuse myself in the past.
And I&#39;m now ashamed I used to do so.</p>
<p>Another user is slightly more friendly, but still also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[This is not on] the engine [..., only] a <strong>wrong expectation</strong> [by you].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a bit of empathy, the same meaning for both replies could be conveyed in a much friendlier way.
Plus I <em>still</em> think that it&#39;s reasonable to expect either the Editor or the Documentation to somehow help users avoid this pitfall.
Especially since behavior <em>inside</em> a component was erratically affected by its siblings.</p>
<p>The second commenter ended with a bonus suggestion too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I recommend joining one of the communities to get feedback and support when looking for a solution and ending up with something that is not working.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Guess that&#39;s a pretty strong hint that I should not be investing in any further interaction with Godot&#39;s GitHub community...</p>
<h3 id="day-31-mixed-feelings--happy">Happy</h3><p>Even through that loss of several hours, I still made some good progress!
So there&#39;s also reasons to be happy.
Above animated gif already showed it, here&#39;s also a still image of the current state of the game:</p>

<p>Lots of the basic interaction has been ported over from <code>prototype-007</code> as well.
But more importantly, the project and file structure are now well-organized and clean.</p>
<p>I&#39;m on schedule to have an alpha version of the game ready for <em>friendly</em> testers near or shortly after the end of this week.
And I&#39;m pretty happy about that.</p>

the alpha release is super-minimal.
Only the very basics are in there, and I&#39;ll use a User Test Script of sorts that fills in the gaps.</p>
<p>So (near) laser-focus on that alpha-release, is what&#39;s up next!</p>

<p><a href="#post-2023-03-13">Yesterday</a> I started the day with a devlog.
It outlined the goals and plan for this current stretch.
Since the end of yesterday you can now publicly track progress <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/orgs/pincrediball/projects/1/views/1'>on the GitHub Kanban Board</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Today I&#39;m building the foundations of the final codebase, using <code>prototype-007</code> as a reference point.
Which involves a ton of struggling with Godot&#39;s haphazard UI layout features.
So there&#39;s little time for an extended devlog.
These few paragraphs will have to do, dear reader!</p>
<p>Catch you tomorrow!
I&#39;m off to get a wee bit more productivity out of today.</p>

          <hr class="my-8 border-t border-t-amber-400/25"><article id="post-2023-03-13" class="scroll-mt-24 prose prose-invert max-w-none"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><h2 id="day-29-planning">Day 29: Planning</h2><p><strong><em>Jeroen</em>, March 13, 2023</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But Jeroen, isn&#39;t halfway into the project a bit late to create a plan!?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why yes, it would be!
But: I already <em>had</em> a plan, just not fully written down.
And now that the end of my mini-sabbatical is nearing, and the plan is becoming fuzzy, it&#39;s time to revise it.</p>
<p>Today I&#39;m writing a devlog <em>fully</em> at the <em>start</em> of the day.
As I write, I&#39;ll create a plan for the remainder of the project.
After that, I&#39;ll commit the rest of the day to taking the first steps.</p>
<h3 id="day-29-planning--original-plan">Original plan</h3><p>So, &quot;what was the &#39;original&#39; not-written-down plan then?&quot;, you may ask.
Well, let&#39;s start with what I <em>did</em> <a href="#post-2023-02-16">write down at the start</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/img/v2023-02-14a-tipm-design-and-brainstorm.png"><img src="/img/v2023-02-14a-tipm-design-and-brainstorm.png" alt="early plans and brainstorm notes"></a></p>
<p>Note that the (respectively) pink and red highlighted items I considered most important.
So the plan was to:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pick a name</strong>, build a website + blog</li>
<li><strong>Design and prototype</strong> something, create primary sprites</li>
<li>Set up something <strong>temporary for sound and music</strong></li>
<li>Create a <strong>fun inner game loop</strong></li>
<li>Learn the <strong>game engine</strong> needed for this</li>
<li>Beta test it, <strong>make sure it&#39;s <em>fun</em></strong> to play</li>
<li><strong>Publish</strong> and release to friends and family</li>
</ol>
<p>The inner game loop would be:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Drag components around</strong> to &quot;design&quot; a machine</li>
<li><strong>Run the playbook</strong> to see how it plays out</li>
</ol>
<p>The secondary game loop:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Run the <em>inner</em> game loop</strong></li>
<li><strong>Check your score</strong> and the medals you got</li>
<li><strong>Unhappy</strong>? Rinse and repeat. <strong>Happy</strong>? Go to next level.</li>
</ol>
<p>The important thing is: <strong>all of the above is still roughly relevant!</strong>
So creating a fresh plan should be easy, right?!</p>
<h3 id="day-29-planning--goals">Goals</h3><p>Before talking about a plan, I need to talk about <em>goals</em>.
Let&#39;s start with the <em>initial</em> goals.
When asked before the start, I&#39;d say something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I develop software for a living.
But I&#39;ve never developed a <em>game</em> before.
So I want to try that.</p>
<p>The goal would be to create one small game, end to end, nearly every part of it created by myself.
And earn at least one euro with it, which can also be my own 1 euro: I just want to see what it takes to getting to <em>publishing</em> a game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s also interesting to now what I did <em>not</em> declare to be my goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>That it should be a <em>good</em> game;</li>
<li>That it should be a <em>successful</em> game (monetarily or otherwise);</li>
<li>That it should be <em>completely</em> finished;</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s <em>very</em> tough to <em>not</em> care about those things.
And to be honest: I <em>do</em> care about all three (in the order above).</p>
<p>But those things were <em>not</em> my goals at the start.
And I think that has remained unchanged.
So the main goals remain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experience what it&#39;s like to <em>develop</em> a game;</li>
<li>Publish <em>something</em> and earn at least one euro with it;</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing my (unchanged) goals, it&#39;s time to create a fresh plan.</p>
<h3 id="day-29-planning--revised-plan">Revised plan</h3><p><a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/pincrediball/prototype-007'>Prototype 007</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a> after <a href="#post-2023-03-10">Day 26</a> gives hope.
It should be good enough to help achieve above-stated goals.
So let&#39;s work from there.
I should make it &quot;official&quot; too, and clean up a bit while doing so.
The first step should therefore be:</p>
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 -->

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Move &quot;Prototype 007&quot; work over into the <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball'>core Pincrediball game repository</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>.
Setting up a proper and clean project structure as I do so.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>After that I should basically have Prototype 007, but in a somewhat clean codebase.
The next steps would be to get to a playable state where I can ask friends to user test it.
To summarize:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Create a MUTeP: a Minimal User Testable Product.
Something that supports the <em>inner</em> game loop.
Plus (possibly with workarounds) lets you imagine how the secondary game loop would work.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>And yes, I just made the &quot;MUTeP&quot; acronym up.</p>
<p>After getting test feedback, things shake up a bit.
Who knows what testers will tell me?
And what changes they require, affecting the plan.
Regardless, the next step should be clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Handle feedback.
Fix the most glaring problems <em>that obstruct the end goals</em>.
Park all other suggestions and problems for the longer term.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>After this some extra feedback rounds may continue.
But looking at the main goals, the prime path to them has another focus.
At this point I should focus on making sure that <em>I myself</em> am happy enough:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Make it publishable.
Make it good enough that I&#39;m willing and happy (enough) to put it up on the web.
Including enough polish to make it presentable, without polishing forever.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally I thought I&#39;d publish mainly (or even only) on Steam.
But I&#39;m changing that a bit.
I&#39;m aiming to publish an alpha version with disclaimers on Itch.io first.
And I&#39;ld be happy with merely a wish-list page for Steam.
In short, the final step for during my mini-sabbatical would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Publish an early-access version.
Can be anywhere, as long as people can pay me an euro for it.
So that I might buy my own game, and accomplish the original goals.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>It <em>feels</em> possible to make these 5 steps in the remaining weeks.
And it would feel great to do so, because I love the dopamine hit from achieving goals I set for myself.</p>
<p>So there you have it, that&#39;s the plan!</p>
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD029 -->

<h3 id="day-29-planning--beyond-the-plan">Beyond the plan</h3><p>My aim with the aforementioned plan is to achieve the initial goals.
There are goals <em>beyond</em> those.
There&#39;s two layers of goals:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>Complete</em> the game and make it <em>good</em> enough for my own tastes.
And then also publish it on Steam.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Try to make it a <em>success</em>.
Which includes a ton of marketing and social media work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go <em>beyond initial success</em>.
Dreaming big, there could be a version 2 of the game, which would be a proper version.
This could include a Kickstarter and/or trying to get extra help on the project.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These are in chronological order, but also in order of how likely they are to happen.
The first one is somewhat likely, as I already sunk the 100 euro&#39;s into Steam to be allowed to publish a game.
But even that goal I might skip.</p>
<p>The good news: I don&#39;t have to decide at the time of writing this.
In fact, <strong>I need to stop writing and start building</strong>.
Otherwise I won&#39;t even be in a position to think about those extended plans.</p>
<p>Off we go!</p>

<p>Wait what&#39;s up!?
A <em>weekend</em> devlog?
That&#39;s a first!</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p>Week 10 started with an <a href="#post-2023-03-06">XXL post on Day 22</a>.
I set three strict goals to achieve for the day.
But I tend to get distracted by random ideas.
Things to procrastinate with.
So I decided to write them down in a little notepad.</p>
<p>But a random file somewhere is no great solution.
So on <a href="#post-2023-03-07">Day 23</a> I decided to stash them into this blog post.
That means the bulk of all ideas were written down during this week.
All ready to go in markdown format.</p>
<h3 id="day-27-weekend-thoughts--where-to-leave-them">Where to leave them?</h3><p>First I figured I&#39;d just finish this blog post with a giant list of ideas.
But now that it&#39;s time to finish the post, I realize: <strong>ideas change, we <em>iterate</em> on them</strong>.
So something less &quot;permanent&quot; or &quot;captured in time&quot; is needed.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a fan of keeping things in once place as much as possible.
It&#39;s also nice to do things out in the open a lot, because it feels like commitments then.
And since they&#39;re markdown already anyways: <strong>let&#39;s stash them into (GitHub) issues</strong>.</p>
<p>Heck, I might even give GitHub&#39;s &quot;projects&quot; feature another go.
Who knows?</p>
<h3 id="day-27-weekend-thoughts--what-are-side-tracks-do-we-have">What are side-tracks do we have?</h3><p>So I don&#39;t like making this blog post a permanent exhaustive list of ideas.
But what I <em>can</em> do is to show off what I&#39;m starting with.
The content is in the git history of this post&#39;s markdown anyways.</p>
<p>So, here&#39;s the current list of ideas.
They&#39;re only the titles now, each linking to where to find them on GitHub:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ideas for Pincrediball.com</strong><ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball.com/issues/1'>Change header levels while transforming markdown</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a></li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Game meta stuff</strong><ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball/issues/1'>Create initial Steam Store page</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a></li>

<li><a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball/issues/4'>Research other relevant Pinball software and games</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&#39;s all the temptations for procrastination I&#39;d written down so far.</p>
<h3 id="day-27-weekend-thoughts--which-core-ideas-are-there">Which core ideas are there?</h3><p>Thoughts and plans for the game itself reside in my head still.
We can&#39;t link to a GitHub issue then, but we can summarize it in one single to-do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project planning</strong>.
Really, I need to set goals (or accept I&#39;ll continue without any).
Create some sort of plan or road map, if I feel like it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball/labels'>labels in GitHub</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a> have been prepared.
So week 5 of development should just start with this to-do.</p>
<h3 id="day-27-weekend-thoughts--anything-else">Anything else?</h3><p>And there&#39;s the ideas that are neither procrastination-worthy (at this moment), nor core to the game.
They don&#39;t deserve a GitHub issue (yet).
So let me just dump them here, so they might not haunt my progress.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kickstarter</strong>.
Even though I&#39;m skeptical about if or when I&#39;m going to finish Pincrediball, I still like to dream big.
If there&#39;s a playable alpha version, it might even be possible to create a Kickstarter.
Even if only to see how that works.</li>
<li><strong>Chase SvelteHack organizers</strong>.
Emailed the organizers of <a target="_blank" href='https://hack.sveltesociety.dev/'>hack.sveltesociety.dev</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a> a while ago.
I&#39;m really curious if my pincrediball.com site would qualify, since light work on it was started just before the official announcement.
Would be good to send another e-mail or something similar, as I haven&#39;t had <em>any</em> response at all.</li>
<li><strong>Devlog graphs</strong>.
I think it would be cool to show a couple of line graphs, detailing aspects of development.
Per day a rating for things like &quot;happiness&quot;, &quot;productivity&quot;, &quot;success&quot;, or possibly others.
And now that things are still fresh, I could fill it in for the past few weeks.
Then again... this idea is a bit &quot;out there&quot;, and not relevant at all to actually building the damn game...</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&#39;s really it.
Now my head is empty.
No more core ideas, procrastination sidetracks, or out-there thoughts left.</p>
<p>In short: I&#39;m ready for week 5!
Bring it.</p>

<p>Today I started like <a href="#post-2023-03-06">past Monday</a>:
by <a target="_blank" href='https://mastodon.social/@jeroenheijmans/109998383905771802'>publicly stating my goals for the day</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>.
Here&#39;s what I&#39;m aiming for today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three goals again today for @pincrediball development:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn Godot&#39;s Drag &amp; Drop system</li>
<li>Allow players to move at least <em>some</em> components around</li>
<li>Learn about Scene Composition in Godot</li>
</ol>
<p>Plus: leave a little bit of energy to do some work on Saturday.
I really need to make some plan for the last few weeks available to finish an alpha version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So technically that&#39;s <em>four</em> goals, I suppose?
Although also technically I did parts of &quot;1&quot; already, as you can tell from <a href="/resources#bookmarks--godot-game-engine">/resources#bookmarks--godot-game-engine</a>.</p>
<p>I will allow myself (at least) one more day to &quot;muddle around&quot; in <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/pincrediball/prototype-007'><code>prototype-007</code> code</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>.
After that I really should be thinking about a somewhat clean codebase for the target alpha release of the game.</p>
<p>For now, let me put down my writing hat, and take a few moments to work through those goals.</p>
<p><em>A few <del>moments</del> hours later...</em></p>
<h3 id="day-26-drag-game--drag-and-drop">Drag and Drop</h3><p>Whelp, that wasn&#39;t trivial.
And as I feared when I just switched to Godot, them introducing a new major version would provide some hurdles.
So <a target="_blank" href='https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/204808/drag-and-drop-differences-between-godot-3-and-4'>a tiny underscore issue</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a> cost me a good two hours.</p>
<p>But, even though a little less polished than I&#39;d like, we do have some results:</p>
<video controls loop style="max-width: 530px">
  <source src="/img/pincrediball-prototype-007-part3.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Video recording the Tutorial Pinball Machine, layer for layer appearing
</video>

<p>So with a bare minimum, I think I made my Drag &amp; Drop goals for today.
In the process I learned enough about Scenes and composing them to keep me rolling.</p>
<h3 id="day-26-drag-game--up-next">Up Next</h3><p>I&#39;ll call the above state today&#39;s check point.
Maybe I&#39;ll do a few small things tonight.
Possibly I&#39;ll do some work on Saturday.
But for now...</p>
<p>Signing off!</p>

<p>Dear reader: thank you!</p>
<p>Because if you&#39;re here, despite me not promoting this post, you must be a real fan!</p>
<p><a href="#post-2023-03-08">Yesterday</a> led to some very tangible success.
As foreshadowed at the end of that post, today will be a shorter day.
So I was planning to spend some time on <strong>research, instead of development</strong>.</p>
<p>My plans include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Structuring Research I&#39;ve already done</li>
<li>Organizing my own glossary</li>
<li>Researching &quot;The Competition&quot; (other Pinball software and games)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#39;s get to the results, shall we!?</p>
<h3 id="day-25-research--structuring-research">Structuring Research</h3><p>I&#39;ve already built up a long list of online resources I&#39;ve used so far.
High time to put this into a better, version controlled format!</p>
<p>The main part of my saved research consists of... <strong>bookmarks</strong>!
Let&#39;s keep it simple for now, and just integrate the most interesting ones with this website.
So without any ado:</p>
<p>Find them all at <a href="/resources#bookmarks">pincrediball.com/resources#bookmarks</a>!</p>
<h3 id="day-25-research--pinball-glossary">Pinball Glossary</h3><p>In my research I&#39;ve found several glossaries for Pinball.
None of them summarize things in a way that suit me.
So it makes sense to create my own.</p>
<p>Same holds here as for the &quot;Research&quot;.
It makes the most sense (for now) to just add it to the website.
So, without any ado:</p>
<p>Find the glossary at <a href="/resources#glossary">pincrediball.com/resources#glossary</a>!</p>
<h3 id="day-25-research--researching-the-competition">Researching &quot;The Competition&quot;</h3><p>If there <em>are</em> any direct competitors, I might as well check them out.
Most likely there <em>will</em> be software to create (and possibly also play) Pinball machines, which I also want to check out.
If there&#39;s time I might check some more general Pinball games.</p>
<p>This item was <em>last</em> in my list, for good reason.
It&#39;s super open-ended, and could take hours, but also days or weeks!</p>
<p>In fact, this goal I&#39;ve missed for today.
I&#39;ll put it into the (forthcoming) blog post on all sorts of random ideas I still have.
But for now: there&#39;s not much more to say.</p>
<h3 id="day-25-research--summarizing">Summarizing</h3><p>Right.
Short days are short.
Shorter even than you&#39;d think.
And I <em>really</em> want to wrap up this post, <em>before</em> I leave for social engagements.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#39;ll revisit this post and the linked resources later in the day.
But most likely... <em>this will be it</em>.
And tomorrow should be another day of actual <em>development</em> work.</p>
<p>Until then!</p>

<p>A strong contender for procrastination of today&#39;s original goals came up.
From a friend I got a link to an old semi-competitor to my own game.
Enough to get me past my original hesitation to research how (un)original my game idea is.
And what I can <em>learn</em> from those other games, of course.</p>
<p>I really <em>must</em> park that, if even for a day.
And focus on the original goals.
More precisely specified, let me say out loud that today I aim to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get at least the <em>sprites</em> in my game for all Tutorial elements;</li>
<li>Get <em>behavior</em> in for round bumpers;</li>
<li>Stretch goal: get behavior in for slings;</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#39;m gonna &quot;state my goals publicly&quot; again.
This time I&#39;ll do so by pushing relevant commits to GitHub early.
I could use the method I introduced earlier (<a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball.com/commit/2d1051a9ab69d92104472ea5e7469d9fd2c3a89b#diff-49d919cc2693b0e3ba9a5cca314294b09fde3e8a1787c4f57a7c658b61fc5092'>with &quot;(DRAFT)&quot; in the title</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>),
but today I&#39;ll just go with the simpler &quot;not yet running <code>npm run build</code> yet&quot;.</p>
<p>At this point it is time to get coding!</p>
<p><em>A few <del>moments</del> hours later...</em></p>
<h3 id="day-24-implementing-the-tutorial-machine--results">Results!</h3><p>That went better than expected!
Got all sprites (except the rails) in the game.
Also got <em>base</em> behavior in there for nearly all of them.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a good recording of where it stands right now:</p>

<p>It&#39;s just insanely fun to watch a &quot;<em>multi-multi-multi-ball</em>&quot; going.
Really that has to become part of the final game somehow.
If only as a &quot;victory dance&quot; after getting the gold medal.</p>
<p>I&#39;m quite excited about these results!
Even though it becomes more clear that this mini-sabbatical is not long enough to complete my entire idea,
I am certainly enjoying myself and learning a ton.
So I&#39;ll happily chug along.</p>
<h3 id="day-24-implementing-the-tutorial-machine--next-up">Next up</h3><p>Tomorrow will be a day with some social engagements.
So perfect for some light in-between work.
Perhaps some research, and a summary on the devlog.</p>
<p>For continued work on the game and more fancy recordings:
stay tuned for later in the week!</p>

<p><a href="#post-2023-03-06">Yesterday</a> was an &quot;XXL&quot; day.
Finished very late as well.
So today I&#39;ll go a little easier.</p>
<h3 id="day-23-designing-the-tutorial-machine--first-half-of-a-blog-post">First half of a blog post</h3><p>Here&#39;s the goal for today:</p>
<ol>
<li>Design a &quot;finished&quot; tutorial machine.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#39;s it.
Just one goal for today.
I&#39;m starting by writing this first half of the blog post.
To gather thoughts and set my goals.
Because that part did work well, yesterday.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s my thoughts on switching back to &quot;Designing&quot; for a bit.
<strong>First up</strong>, I <em>enjoyed</em> doing the designs.
So it&#39;s easy to stay motivated this way.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, it will <em>fixate scope</em> for the Pinball Machine components of the Tutorial stage.
So it should help me keep things small (enough).
And free up some mental space, once those things are &quot;on paper&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong>, and most importantly:
it should help me <em>flesh out the core game concepts</em>.
The Tutorial machine should &quot;proof&quot; that the game loops are <em>fun</em>.
Or it will <em>disproof</em> that, and allow me to pivot if needed.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, let me get to creating those designs...</p>
<p>...<em>a few <del>moments</del> hours later</em>:</p>
<h3 id="day-23-designing-the-tutorial-machine--second-half-of-a-blog-post">Second half of a blog post</h3><p>We&#39;re at the end of the day, and there&#39;s <em>some</em> result.
Not entirely happy yet, but &quot;good enough&quot; for now.</p>
<p>Decided to &quot;work backwards&quot; with level design.
First I designed <em>one configuration</em> of the tutorial stage that finishes the last level with at least bronze.
Here&#39;s the completed machine, as it&#39;s built up from the ground:</p>
<video controls loop style="max-width: 530px">
  <source src="/img/pincrediball-prototype-007-design-buildup.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Video recording the Tutorial Pinball Machine, layer for layer appearing
</video>

<p>Outer bounds and background artwork will always be visible to the player.
Components can be placed nearly anywhere on the field.
The artwork is supposed to be a guided tutorial for where things could have a nice placement.</p>
<p>Quests (if ever) can be added to the tutorial by just completing the various goals a set number of time.
The center artwork could just light up more firmly for each achieved goal.
And perhaps increase the multiplier for scores by doing so?</p>
<p>Next day(s) I will try to move all these components into Godot.
Programming their features as I go along.
At some point the entire pinball machine should be &quot;done&quot;.
I guess if I add keybindings for the flippers I will have made a basic flipper game?</p>
<p>After that I&#39;m planning to add the actual core features:
players can move around components, then run playbooks to achieve high scores.
I&#39;m sure to run into design troubles at that stage.</p>
<p>But for now, this result will have to do!</p>
<h3 id="day-23-designing-the-tutorial-machine--summarizing">Summarizing</h3><p>A limited goal for the day, and that worked out just fine!
Moderately happy with this result, even though I guess all I did was &quot;<em>design a mediocre Pinball Machine</em>&quot;.
Curious to see if I can <em>at least</em> turn that into a <em>working</em> &quot;mediocre Pinball game&quot;...</p>

<p>Fresh week, fresh energy.
Started the week by <a target="_blank" href='https://mastodon.social/@jeroenheijmans/109975463331122581'>committing &quot;publicly&quot; (on Mastodon) to three small goals for today</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Design the tutorial machine with initial art</li>
<li>Put the design into Godot</li>
<li>Allow plunging a single ball through it</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally (to &quot;publicly stating goals&quot;) I&#39;m also going to get all other productivity tricks that work for me going.
One of which is &quot;writing my way through it&quot;.
That is: <strong>I&#39;m going to rubber duck by writing an <em>extra long devlog</em></strong> to keep me going.</p>
<p>⚠ If you&#39;re here for more casual devlogs, <strong>then I recommend to stop reading after his paragraph</strong>.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>If you&#39;re here for the full stream-of-consciousness, then saddle in! We&#39;re about to dive deep.</p>
<h3 id="day-22-prototype-007-xxl-devlog--1-designing-the-tutorial-machine">1. Designing the tutorial machine</h3><p>Designing Pinball machines is a skill on its own.
I have no such skill, but I&#39;ve tried to do a base level of research.
Amongst others, having checked <a target="_blank" href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSw7fK6x1mw&list=PL-WQLGFMr97CQpOQDEvRqAiSqcvSuK11h&index=3'>several PAPAPinball YouTube &quot;Machine Tutorials&quot;</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>
I see several aspects of a good Pinball machine:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Theme</strong> that&#39;s appealing (often tied to an existing brand, like &quot;Batman&quot; or &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;);</li>
<li><strong>Backplate</strong> with artwork around the theme;</li>
<li><strong>Quests</strong>: hitting specific targets in specific orders, in a way that&#39;s also fun and challenging;</li>
<li><strong>Toys</strong> are extra-special (often gimicky and theme-related) components of the machine that do something crazy when hit;</li>
<li><strong>Balance</strong> between how hard goals are to hit (and how big a chance you have to drain the ball), and how many points they give;</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_7TQ6wRZdw&list=PL-WQLGFMr97DnxeE1Rmi-wAwa-Vm7D-7i'><strong>Flipper tricks</strong></span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a> should allow skilled players to be better at the game;</li>
<li><strong>Multi-ball</strong> mode is usually a goal to work towards, preferably when <strong>&quot;multipliers&quot;</strong> are enabled;</li>
<li><strong>Basic components</strong> that <em>must</em> be included:
plunger (with plunger lane and a gate),
flippers,
balls,
lanes,
spinners,
bumpers,
drop targets,
slingshots,
and rollovers.</li>
<li><strong>Extra components</strong> should probably also be included:
backbox and display,
outlanes,
ramps,
gates,
and kickbacks.</li>
<li><strong>Skill Shots</strong> (plunging the initial ball at a particular speed to hit a particular target) are perfect for Pincrediball too.
Especially in the tutorial levels, the &quot;Playbook&quot; could contain a precise skill shot.
This makes it super fun to place the initial components in a very precise location.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#39;ll start with designing the theme, backplate, and quests.
One theme per &quot;stage&quot; of the game, so multiple levels are on the same theme.
The <em>Tutorial</em> stage is up first.
Although I don&#39;t have a good term or word for the theme yet, it&#39;ll revolve around:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stick figures and a &quot;math&quot; paper background;</li>
<li>A limited color scheme with shades of blue, and some black and white;</li>
<li>Quests to build up a mini-comic lit up on the backplate;</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point I&#39;ll stop writing out my thoughts on this blog post.
It&#39;s time to grab a tool to design the initial art!</p>
<p><em>...a few <del>moments</del> hours later</em>:</p>
<p><a href="/img/pincrediball-prototype-007-figma.png"><img src="/img/pincrediball-prototype-007-figma.png" alt="Pinball machine in progress"></a></p>
<p>This gives me something to work with!
Interesting notes about the design:</p>
<ul>
<li>The plunger lane includes an amber-colored gate that should be &quot;one-way&quot; for the ball;</li>
<li>The three gates at the top are for points, and to be placed by the player in the game to create high scores;</li>
<li>There&#39;s a tiny start for stick-figure art in the main area, which will indicate quest progress;</li>
<li>I&#39;m a noob at Figma, yet still made it work decently well!</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to continue tweaking this design, but I <em>must</em> move on.
There&#39;s still two goals left for today.
Time for a quick break, and then on to the next part.</p>
<h3 id="day-22-prototype-007-xxl-devlog--2-putting-it-into-godot">2. Putting it into Godot</h3><p>For some reason I figured that having SVG&#39;s in Figma would make it easy to import everything into Godot.
I was half right.
The <em>wrong</em> half.</p>
<p>Importing the &quot;Art&quot; as textures was very easy.</p>
<p>But the important half was not so easy; perhaps more research is needed?
I was hoping the SVG paths would be useful as collision shapes.
Especially the bezier curves seemed logical for a pinball machine.
I set myself certain goals for today, and getting this bit perfect would hold me back.</p>
<p>So, I went the labor-intensive route.
Importing the design of the machine in chunks from Figma.
And after that... <em>manually tracing over those shapes again</em>, to create the collision polygons.
So...</p>
<p><em>...a few <del>moments</del> hours later</em>:</p>
<p><a href="/img/pincrediball-prototype-007-godot.png"><img src="/img/pincrediball-prototype-007-godot.png" alt="Pinball machine in progress"></a></p>
<p>That at least should work to some degree!
Let&#39;s have a look, shall we?</p>
<h3 id="day-22-prototype-007-xxl-devlog--3-allow-plunging-a-ball">3. Allow plunging a ball</h3><p>Time to program a little bit of interactivity.
The plan was as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A &quot;Plunge&quot; button that spawns a ball and shoots it into the field;</li>
<li><strong>Bonus:</strong> Flippers that just constantly, well, flipper;</li>
</ul>
<p>After a bunch of trial and error;
after a ton of Godot 3.x to 4.0 translation;
after loads of debugging and tweaking;
in short after...</p>
<p><em>...a few <del>moments</del> hours later</em>:</p>
<video controls loop>
  <source src="/img/pincrediball-prototype-007.mp4" type="video/mp4" />

</video>

<p>I have a ton of concerns still.
Most notably if this will be deterministic enough for my core game idea.
But concerns be damned, <strong>I&#39;m pretty content with this result!</strong></p>
<h3 id="day-22-prototype-007-xxl-devlog--recap">Recap</h3><p>In short, I achieved what I set out to do:
(1) design a machine, (2) put it in Godot, and (3) have basic ball physics.
Setting the goals at the start certainly helped.
Tomorrow I might go for a more free-form day, but soon after I&#39;ll certainly use this same trick again.</p>
<p>If you made it this far into my stream-of-consciousness post:
I salute you!
You&#39;re the best.</p>
<p>On to the next bits!</p>

<p>Got up an hour later than I wanted.
Enjoyed a visit from a friend, preferred chatting over working on the project.
Some spinning while watching Rick &amp; Morty.
And some LEGO Star War with the Mrs.</p>
<p>In short: not much game dev was done today.</p>
<p>Perhaps I&#39;ll catch up over the weekend.
Or maybe I&#39;ll just reboot next week.
I&#39;m fine with either, it&#39;s a <em>vacation</em> project, after all.
We&#39;ll see!</p>
<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></article>
          <hr class="my-8 border-t border-t-amber-400/25"><article id="post-2023-03-02" class="scroll-mt-24 prose prose-invert max-w-none"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><h2 id="day-18-prototype-006-with-godot">Day 18: Prototype 006 with Godot</h2><p><strong><em>Jeroen</em>, March 02, 2023</strong></p>
<p>Today I followed advice from friends.
Godot got several more recommendations.
And right after I decided to take it for a spin, <a target="_blank" href='https://godotengine.org/article/godot-4-0-sets-sail/'>Godot 4.0 was released</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After 3+ years of breaking and rebuilding from the ground up, a complete core overhaul and a full engine rewrite: <strong>Welcome to the start of Godot 4!</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that&#39;s both good and bad.
It&#39;s nice that I join in right when a boost in new modern features is released.</p>
<p>But as I suspected, it&#39;s less nice that we&#39;re now in a state of limbo.
Documentation has warnings all over the place that they might still be out of date.
Online examples are thoroughly broken.
All forum posts and Q&amp;A online still uses the 3.x way of things.</p>
<p>But if I download the 3.x LTS version, I&#39;m learning obsolete skills from the get go.
So Godot 4.0 it was.</p>
<h3 id="day-18-prototype-006-with-godot--prototype-mini-game">Prototype? Mini-game!</h3><p>I named it &quot;prototype 006&quot; and might still put the code online as such.
But I mainly set out to just build a tiny game with Godot.</p>
<p>As a teenager I&#39;d lie on my back in my room, endlessly tossing a small ball in the air.
The goal?
To get as close to the ceiling as possible, <em>without</em> actually hitting it.</p>
<p>So I made it into a tiny Godot game.
Really wanted to make it playable in the browser, more on that in a second.
First, an example of what it looks like:</p>
<p><a href="/img/pincrediball-prototype-006.gif"><img src="/img/pincrediball-prototype-006.gif" alt="Animated gif of a ball bouncing in the air for score"></a></p>
<p>You press <code>[SPACE]</code> or <code>[LEFT MOUSE BUTTON]</code> for 0 to 2000 milliseconds to send it flying up.
The higher you get, the more points you score.
If you hit the ceiling?
Zero points.</p>
<p>Actually fun to build.
Mostly without frustration.
Better than Phaser, certainly.
This is looking promising!</p>
<h3 id="day-18-prototype-006-with-godot--godot-exports">Godot exports</h3><p>The actual exporting to platforms is a bit more finnicky.
Android requires the SDK so I&#39;m yet to try that.
iOS similarly likely needs special stuff.</p>
<p>The <code>.exe</code> Windows version was somehwat easy.
It includes the entire Godot engine though.
So my super-simple game becomes 45+ MB: not great.</p>
<p>The &quot;html5&quot; version is even worse.
The WASM file also clocks in at similar size.
But worse: it requires quite modern but certainly not ubiquitous Web Server headers.
The response from the Godot team was, understandably but frustratingly:
<a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/69020#issuecomment-1324253401'>&quot;This is a Web Server problem that Web Servers should fix&quot;</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>.</p>
<p>It seems that <a target="_blank" href='https://stackoverflow.com/q/68609682/419956'>support for needed headers</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a> won&#39;t easily work on GitHub Pages.
So no runnable version of the game on this devlog for now.</p>
<h3 id="day-18-prototype-006-with-godot--now-what">Now what?</h3><p>It&#39;d be really sad if my final game wouldn&#39;t run well in browsers.
Both a demo version on the website, as well as an itch.io version, would be problematic.
But I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll let that hold me back.
Tomorrow I&#39;ll sleep in, and at some point go back to toying with Godot.
Mainly because it was <em>fun</em> to do so!</p>

<p>I&#39;m giving up.</p>
<p>The past few days have been extremely frustrating.
I&#39;m spending <em>days</em> on trivial things like <a target="_blank" href='https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/204691/how-to-make-object-movable-only-by-the-player'>making objects only movable by a player</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>.
In those days I&#39;m also loosing <em>hours</em> on how utterly inconsistent and unpredictable the Phaser and Matter API are for nontrivial things.</p>
<p>Summarizing those two things differently:</p>
<ol>
<li>Core Pincrediball concepts are nontrivial in Phaser&#39;s physics engine;</li>
<li>Phaser itself and its engine are frustrating to work with so far;</li>
</ol>
<p>So I&#39;m giving up.
On my current approach.</p>
<h3 id="day-17-giving-up--what-now-then">What now then?</h3><p>Well, I need to mentally reset.
So tomorrow I&#39;ll start with a completely fresh approach.
Not sure which yet.</p>
<p>To end this day with a brainstorm of a few possible roads to take:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stick with Phaser and MatterJS?</strong>
Still try to stay with Phaser, revitalize, and try to make Matter physics work for me?
Probably I should know better, given how frustrated I am right now.</li>
<li><strong>Stick with Phaser and a new Physics engine?</strong>
Stay with Phaser, but see if there&#39;s a way to get <strong>Box2D</strong> to work with it?
I found <a target="_blank" href='http://phaser.io/examples/v2/box2d/pinball'>the Pinball(!) example</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a> but it was for the years old version 2 of Phaser.</li>
<li><strong>Try out Godot, or Unity?</strong>
The main alternatives I&#39;d consider (next to very maybe GameMaker).
I&#39;m just super-worried that I first need a few weeks to learn them.</li>
<li><strong>Rolling my own engine?</strong>
This seemed like a bad idea <a href="#post-2023-02-22">after day 10</a>.
But perhaps I should give it another go?</li>
<li><strong>Quit building, start (more) procrastination?</strong>
To be honest, I&#39;ve been enjoying everything <em>except</em> building the damn game a lot.
The website, the socials, the designs, the (not-yet-existent) Kickstarter...
Perhaps I should embrace those first?</li>
<li><strong>Quit altogether?</strong>
I have 4 out of 8 weeks left in my mini-sabbatical.
There&#39;s plenty of things to do in those weeks, other than building a game.</li>
</ul>
<p>And surely there are more options.
I&#39;ll sleep on it, and decide when I&#39;m fresh at it again.
It&#39;s not very likely that I&#39;ll &quot;Quit altogether&quot;, but I&#39;m keeping options open:
first and foremost I want to be having fun.
And, surprise: all through abovementioned frustration, I&#39;m still having fun!</p>
<p>But for now, I need a break.</p>

<p>Second day of week 3, and although I <em>am</em> pushing myself through <em>some</em> relevant work, I&#39;m not making the progress I wanted.</p>
<p>Heck, I&#39;m even writing this recap at the start of day 16.
So I&#39;m keeping it short, so I can try once more to get some work in.</p>
<p>What I did yesterday is to commit on a setup.
I did not name my repository for the day <code>prototype-...</code>.
No, I actually started the main game repository.
And I merged the best bits from earlier prototype.</p>
<p>That means the day after this one, there are really no excuses left.
Work has to be done on the game.

<p>First day of week 3 of the project, day 15 of the project.</p>
<p>I&#39;m writing an early devlog today.
After writing this I will probably <em>continue</em> development.
But I feel like I reached a checkpoint <em>now</em>, so a recap is in order.</p>
<h3 id="day-15-prototype-005--prototype-004">Prototype 004</h3><p>Looking at the overview of posts you may wonder: &quot;What happened to prototype 004?&quot;.
Glad you asked!
In fact, on <a href="#post-2023-02-24">Day 12</a> I combined Phaser with Svelte;
only at the end of that day did I &quot;promote&quot; it to <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/orgs/pincrediball/repositories?q=prototype'>its own prototype repository</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>.
Quite likely <code>prototype-004</code> will even grow into the end result at some point.</p>
<h3 id="day-15-prototype-005--ladies-and-gentlemen-prototype-number-005">Ladies and Gentlemen: Prototype Number 005!</h3><p>So, today I got up fresh and early.
The main problem to tackle: <strong>some (more) determinism</strong> in runs.
Otherwise the core game loop (precisely placing parts so you get a high score) is no fun.</p>
<p>Determinism turns out to be quite difficult with MatterJS.
But that&#39;s only one problem.
It has no Continuous Collision Detection (CCD) either, causing the ball at high velocity to go <em>through</em> walls.
This might get worse once I get to implementing flippers, I suspect.
So I was doubting my engine choice a bit.</p>
<p>Still, after a productive morning, I found that things might be good enough for now.
I tweaked the engine settings to a point where many parallel instances of my game would all give the same result.
Here&#39;s <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/pincrediball/prototype-005'>the &quot;proof&quot; of that</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>:</p>
<video controls loop>
  <source src="/img/pincrediball-prototype-005.mp4" type="video/mp4" />

</video>

<p>This prototype made two things clear to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>It gives enough <em>confidence</em> to move forward with my current setup;</li>
<li>It causes enough <em>doubt</em> that this engine should be the final choice for a <em>full</em> game;</li>
</ul>
<p>In short: a nice check point reached!</p>
<h3 id="day-15-prototype-005--whats-next">What&#39;s next?</h3><p>So the next steps are to go &quot;all in&quot; on the current approach.
More specifically, my to do list is currently:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design a good looking tutorial theme and pinball machine;</li>
<li>Integrate that design, Prototype 004, and Prototype nr. 5;</li>
<li>Allow the player to move bumpers around</li>
<li>Add flippers to the game;</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps a few sound effects to make working on this project a bit more fun too.
I will roll up the rest of today&#39;s work in the next devlog entry either way.
Stay tuned!</p>

<p>I&#39;m back to integrating PhaserJS with the MatterJS physics engine, and Svelte.
The fourth prototype uses some of the domain entities from prototype-003.
And it includes a Phaser scene for the actual Pinball machine.</p>
<p>For lack of time (the weekend calls for other obligations) I&#39;ll just use a static screenshot for the blog:</p>
<p><a href="/img/pincrediball-prototype-004-part1.png"><img src="/img/pincrediball-prototype-004-part1.png" alt="Game in a browser window"></a></p>
<p>The rest of today was spent on trying to make Matter more deterministic.
And in that process I got (again) a bit side tracked with <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/liabru/matter-js/issues/256#issuecomment-1443680697'>an energy conservation issue</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a> with MatterJS.</p>
<p>So we close off this week with far less results than I&#39;d hoped.
For a large part because I procrastinated and let myself get side tracked though.
What all that does mean is that I need to re-evaluate my goals and approach next week.</p>
<p>What&#39;s super important is that the machine becomes more deterministic.
The whole &quot;automata player&quot; and game loop idea falls apart if different runs of the automata have different outcomes.
Either the setup needs to become (more) deterministic, or the game loop has to change.
Or my goals for the project need to change...</p>
<p>Got a weekend to chew on that though.</p>

<p>I let myself get sidetracked...</p>
<p>Not sure how much it is to procrastinate working on the actual game.
But I <em>am</em> sure that it sparked joy to play around with something else.
Here&#39;s what I changed up for this pincrediball.com&#39;s website source code.</p>
<h3 id="day-11-sidetracked-with-markdown--prose-tailwindcss-plugin">Prose TailwindCSS plugin</h3><p>Tailwind resets styling, so you can reliably create Web Applications and Sites.
That&#39;s all great, but for long-form textual content it&#39;s actually painful to loose <em>all</em> styling.
<a target="_blank" href='https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin'>The Tailwind &quot;Prose&quot; plugin</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a> aims to solve that, without compromising the reset of styles that Tailwind gives you.</p>
<p>It was just fine to write this devlog straight up with html and Tailwind classes.
But copy-pasting things like <code>mt-4</code> on each <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> becomes tedious pretty quickly.
The Prose plugin fixes that nicely, and cleaned up my devlog source code considerably.</p>
<h3 id="day-11-sidetracked-with-markdown--markdown-for-blogging">Markdown for blogging</h3><p>This also enables the next step.
Markdown is a far nicer format to write blogposts in.
I had noticed before that <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/sveltejs/sites/tree/master/sites/svelte.dev/content/blog'><code>svelte.dev</code> uses markdown for their blog</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>,
which sparked my interest.</p>
<p>After briefly trying the (rather nice!) <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/ssssota/svelte-exmarkdown'>svelte-exmarkdown</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a> library, I decided I needed a bit more control.
So I dove a bit deeper into how <code>svelte.dev</code> does things.
And that setup is quite nice indeed, as it includes support for SSR and RSS.</p>
<p>So, I used a (much) simplified variant of that setup.
And: it works like a breeze!
Adding a blog post can now be as simple as <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball.com/commit/22f4cb509b4c4fbe3b81eb4089af522c21a14bb5'>adding one <code>.md</code> file to the repository</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>!</p>
<h3 id="day-11-sidetracked-with-markdown--whats-next">What&#39;s next?</h3><p>That&#39;s all nice!
But what&#39;s next?
Should I ever feel like getting side-tracked again, there&#39;s a few things left to tweak:</p>
<ul>
<li>RSS feed would be nice;</li>
<li>Having <code>[slug]</code> based pages might be nice;</li>
<li>GitHub Action to <code>npm run build</code> would be nice;</li>
<li>GitHub Action to deploy GH-Pages should be nice;</li>
</ul>
<p>But for now: let&#39;s stop procrastination and get back to building the game.
Shall we?</p>

<p>Well... that was a disaster!</p>
<p>As warned by folks around me, and just as I already sortof knew would happen:
<em>rolling your own</em> (engine) is a bad idea.
Generally.
And specifically, too (at least for this case).</p>
<p>After a few hours of labor here&#39;s where I got:</p>
<video controls loop>
  <source src="/img/pincrediball-prototype-003.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Video recording of an extremely crude demo pinball machine.
</video>

<p>And then the mountain of work became visible.</p>
<p>The smart thing to do?
Enjoy a few other fun things in my sabbatical, let the project lie down for a bit.
I&#39;ll likely revitalize my enthusiasm for the project and go back to using an existing engine.
Possibly within this web app that&#39;s now set up.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for prototype <em>004</em> soon (?).
I&#39;m calling it an early day, on Day 10.</p>
<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></article>
          <hr class="my-8 border-t border-t-amber-400/25"><article id="post-2023-02-21" class="scroll-mt-24 prose prose-invert max-w-none"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><h2 id="day-9-prototype-003-part-1">Day 9: Prototype 003, part 1</h2><p><strong><em>Jeroen</em>, February 21, 2023</strong></p>
<p>After <a href="#post-2023-02-20">yesterday</a> several friends helped out with some rubber duck debugging.
Got some great input on Slack and in other places about how I could wrangle the physics engine collisions into submission.
And how much I should probably let go and embrace the chaos of a realistic engine.</p>
<p>However, I still changed it up... for prototyping purposes!</p>
<p>Using PhaserJS and MatterJS might <em>still</em> be the right way to go.
But I still wanted to try out how it feels to create a fully custom engine anyways.</p>
<p>And while I was at that, I was also curious to see how far I can get with plain html, css, and JavaScript (and no <em>game</em> engine).
Using SvelteKit and Tailwind, just for prototyping speed at the moment.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t get very far yet with writing the actual game loop and time ticker.
But I did do a bunch of good work on an initial game layout.
It&#39;s far from polished, but (even though polish might be 80% of the work?!) that&#39;s for later.
Here&#39;s the initial results:</p>
<p><a href="/img/pincrediball-prototype-003-part1a.png"><img src="/img/pincrediball-prototype-003-part1a.png" alt="Game in a browser window"></a></p>
<p>Obviously, this still needs work.
But it&#39;s getting somewhere.
Even if I go the PhaserJS route after all, I might be able to use this setup in conjunction with it.</p>
<p>And I&#39;m sorry to say: that&#39;s all for today, folks!</p>
<p>As a final footnote for today&#39;s devlog: I also decided to open source the prototypes.
So you can fully see me fumbling about.
Writing all sorts of just-make-it-work code.
You can find <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/pincrediball'>all the repositories in the Pincrediball GitHub organization</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>.
And for my most loyal readers (hi mum!), here&#39;s a quick peek at it, with just a random screenshot of me hacking about in prototype number three!</p>
<p><a href="/img/pincrediball-prototype-003-part1b.png"><img src="/img/pincrediball-prototype-003-part1b.png" alt="VSCode showing prototype-003 files"></a></p>
<p>Prototype 003 will likely get some more love the coming days.
Stay tuned!</p>

<p>After not doing too much during the weekend (days 6 &amp; 7), it&#39;s now Monday of week 2 and high time to get back to the project.
After a week of &quot;meta&quot; stuff, designing, and a super-light prototype, today was spent on more in-depth prototyping.</p>
<p>I&#39;m very happy with what I <em>did</em>, but only moderately so with the <em>result</em>.
Here, have a look for yourself first:</p>
<video controls loop>
  <source src="/img/pincrediball-prototype-002.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Video recording of an extremely crude demo pinball machine.
</video>

<p><small>(Note that you see the debug boxes and vectors in these prototypes.)</small></p>
<p>Let&#39;s summarize what I learned during today&#39;s experiments, starting with the positives:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ SvelteKit will be a great &quot;bearer&quot; of the game</li>
<li>✅ Using plain html/css/js for parts of the app will likely turn out great</li>
<li>✅ Tailwind enables for fast menu&#39;s and other UI</li>
<li>✅ I got <em>something</em> looking like Pinball physics to work</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I have many concerns after today:</p>
<ul>
<li>❌ MatterJS physics is wonky ls going <em>through</em> static bounds or getting stuck</li>
<li>❌ Level editing is cumbersome in (vanilla) Phaser, without any tools</li>
<li>❌ Curved shapes and SVG paths are a <em>major</em> pain to use</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m not so sure yet where to go from here.
Have I learned that I need to go back to my original idea?
Building a super-simple physics engine of my own, to make everything far more deterministic and reliable?
Or should I stick with out-of-the-box physics and just deal with the issues?</p>
<p>Perhaps a night&#39;s sleep and some distraction will bring clarity.</p>

          <hr class="my-8 border-t border-t-amber-400/25"><article id="post-2023-02-17" class="scroll-mt-24 prose prose-invert max-w-none"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><h2 id="day-5-prototype-001">Day 5: Prototype 001</h2><p><strong><em>Jeroen</em>, February 17, 2023</strong></p>
<p>Today was not a very productive day, mostly because I didn&#39;t spend too much time on the project.
Still, got to a very first prototype with a plunger and a ball, plus some physics:</p>
<video controls loop>
  <source
    src="/img/pincrediball-prototype-001.webm"
    type="video/webm; codecs=vp9,vorbis"
  />
  <source src="/img/pincrediball-prototype-001.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Video recording of an extremely crude demo pinball machine.
</video>

<p>It seems the choice for PhaserJS with the MatterJS physics engine is &quot;good enough&quot; for my goals.
And I think I will just leave it to chance that I chose right, instead of heavily investigating other Game Engines.</p>
<p>That&#39;s it for day 5.
Weekend&#39;s up next, we&#39;ll see if I continue work, or whether the next update will come on Monday...</p>

          <hr class="my-8 border-t border-t-amber-400/25"><article id="post-2023-02-16" class="scroll-mt-24 prose prose-invert max-w-none"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><h2 id="day-4-engines-on">Day 4: Engine&#39;s on!</h2><p><strong><em>Jeroen</em>, February 16, 2023</strong></p>
<p>Today it&#39;s time to figure out an engine to use.
I&#39;m leaning heavily towards <a target="_blank" href='https://phaser.io/'>PhaserJS</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a> (the main alternatives being Godot and Unity),
because it allows me to tap into my existing web development and JavaScript skills.</p>
<p>I&#39;m mostly doing tutorials and reading documentation, so no exciting updates from today for the devlog.
That does give me a minute to share my rough &quot;plan&quot; I created earlier in the project.
Here it is:</p>
<p><a href="/img/v2023-02-14a-tipm-brainstorm.png"><img src="/img/v2023-02-14a-tipm-brainstorm.png" alt="Brainstorm overview divided in 6 sections: Design, Graphics/Art, Sound/Music, Game Loop/Engine, Polish, Publish"></a></p>
<p>It started as a brainstorm, but it became a rough &quot;plan&quot;.
Each of the six parts is roughly a time box of one week.
I&#39;m starting with &quot;Design&quot; this week, but currently borrowing a bit from the next goal: &quot;Game Loop / Engine&quot;.</p>
<p>Stuff&#39;s color coded too: the red stuff is Must-Haves, yellow Should-Haves, and green the Nice-to-Haves.</p>
<p>What do you think?
Too optimistic?
Probably.
But let&#39;s see how far we&#39;ll get, shall we?!</p>
<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></article>
          <hr class="my-8 border-t border-t-amber-400/25"><article id="post-2023-02-15" class="scroll-mt-24 prose prose-invert max-w-none"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><h2 id="day-3-website-first">Day 3: Website first?</h2><p><strong><em>Jeroen</em>, February 15, 2023</strong></p>
<p>Continuing from day 2 with a focus on <em>fun</em> activities, I decided to finish up the website.
This time I don&#39;t think I can claim anymore that it&#39;s in the end somehow part of the <em>critical path</em> though?</p>
<p>But regardless of whether it was <em>The Right Thing</em> to do right now, it <em>was</em> very effective!
I mean: you&#39;re looking at the very result right now.</p>
<p>The website was built with SvelteKit and TailwindCSS, which was rather efficient because I recently used it for both of my other recent side-projects:
<a target="_blank" href='https://tierdom.jeroenheijmans.nl'>Tierdom</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a> and <a target="_blank" href='https://vesta.infi.nl'>vesta.infi.nl</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>.
But not before I spent the entire morning learning some more Figma skills to do the entire design first.</p>
<p>I only bought the domain name, used
<a target="_blank" href='https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages#using-an-apex-domain-for-your-github-pages-site'>GitHub pages with a custom and apex domain</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>
for hosting the whole thing.
Which, after the usual DNS hassle, works quite well!</p>
<p>All this means three important things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can <em>comfortably share</em> the plans with the world</li>
<li>I am <em>on schedule</em> for week 1&#39;s plans</li>
<li>I have <em>no excuses left</em> to procrastinate prototyping</li>
</ul>
<p>So let&#39;s end this third day with some initial social media posts and links to this website.</p>
<p><strong>And tomorrow: we prototype!</strong></p>

<p>Second day I allowed myself to get side-tracked.
I decided that the best way to keep motivation high was by <em>doing essential things disguised as non-essential things</em>.
By this I mean I tried to incorporate essential things (work on the designs and game idea) into far less essential things (that were enjoyable to do).</p>
<p>First thing I did was to <strong>redo the main game screen&#39;s design</strong>.
For fun I&#39;ve shared that on the (current, at the time of writing) <a href="/">home page</a>.
After that I took care of a bunch of other non-essential (but fun!) things:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ Logo &amp; Banner designed</li>
<li>✅ YouTube channel claimed</li>
<li>✅ Itch.io account claimed</li>
<li>✅ Socials set up</li>
<li>✅ SteamWorks application submitted (and $100 fee paid...)</li>
</ul>
<p>It was a <em>fun</em> day with this too, as you can tell from <a target="_blank" href='https://mastodon.social/@jeroenheijmans/109865321998439644'>my related toot</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>.
And it really gave me a bunch of inspiration and energy to continue on!</p>

<p>First day of the week I decided to start the project.
However, the night before we watched the Super Bowl... in the GMT+1 timezone!
So was up until 04:30 (that&#39;s AM for y&#39;all), naturally this wasn&#39;t the most productive day.</p>
<p>But the most important thing got done: I got <em>started</em> on the project!
Plus several important things got done nonetheless, as <a target="_blank" href='https://mastodon.social/@jeroenheijmans/109859902264743330'>I wrote on Mastodon</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ Brainstorm done</li>
<li>✅ Rough plan created</li>
<li>✅ Name chosen</li>
<li>✅ Domain bought!</li>
<li>✅ GitHub org and repo&#39;s claimed</li>
<li>✅ Social media names claimed</li>
<li>✅ Game loop basics designed</li>
<li>✅ Initial designs</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end would call day 1 a success!</p>

do:\r\n\r\n\u003Cvideo controls loop\u003E\r\n  \u003Csource src=\"\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-v1-20230321-drag-and-drop-basics.mp4\" type=\"video\u002Fmp4\" \u002F\u003E\r\n  Video recording showing drag and drop of Pinball machine components\r\n\u003C\u002Fvideo\u003E\r\n\r\n_Super_ clunky, but you might get the basic idea?\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nSo we achieved quite a bit today:\r\n\r\n- ✔ Dragging \"new\" components from the toolbox on the left to the playing field\r\n- ✔ Dragging \"existing\" components on the playfield around\r\n- ✔ Crude animation (green flashing area) of the valid drop area\r\n- ✔ Fallback for when trying to drop outside the valid area\r\n\r\nIn addition to some other unrelated improvements:\r\n\r\n- ✔ Music and SFX toggle buttons\r\n- ✔ Run Playbook option will now reset the balls\r\n- ✔ Official \"Stress Test\" option to fire off 10 balls\r\n- ✔ Score reset when running playbooks\r\n- ✔ Score disabled during a \"Stress Test\"\r\n\r\nBut there's a ton left that's not (yet) working surrounding Drag & Drop functionality:\r\n\r\n- ❌ Rotating certain components (bumper pills and wall corners) is missing\r\n- ❌ Toolbox items should be usable only the allotted number of times, not infinitely\r\n- ❌ You should _not_ be able to move items during a play run\r\n- ❌ Each Playbook should get a maximum number of seconds of runtime\r\n- ❌ A \"Stop Playbook\" option is needed\r\n- ❌ The \"Toolbox\" looks ugly and cramped, the layout needs work\r\n\r\nAnd given the late hour when I write this probably a few more things.\r\n\r\n### Kowalski, analysis!\r\n\r\nThe situation is... ~grim~ ~dire~ ~ugly~ ~promising~... frustrating?\r\nGodot and game development are a struggle (for a web developer by trade).\r\nAround every corner there's a new gotcha waiting, it seems.\r\nPerhaps my expectation of picking it up quickly given software development skills in other areas was unrealistic?\r\n\r\nEither way I'm proud to be pressing on.\r\nAnd proudly press on, I shall!\r\nThe quality might not be where I want it to be, but my [goals](#day-29-planning--goals) I _will_ reach!\r\n\r\nOnward.\r\n";b.id="post-2023-03-20";b.isDraft=false;b.order=2;b.date=new Date(1679270400000);b.title="Day 36: Dragging my feat...";b.content="## Day 36: Dragging my

Pinball components today.\r\nWhich brings me to say...\r\n\r\n**Whelp!**\r\nDoing drag and drop in Godot is not easy ~at all~.\r\nThe very first steps are trivial.\r\nMany tutorials describe how it's done.\r\nBut the edges... are rough.\r\nAnd when I get distracted, I get _distracted_;\r\nand I'll write an entire sample of [how Drag & Drop could be done](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fjeroenheijmans\u002Fsample-godot-drag-drop-from-control-to-node2d).\r\nGuess I'd summarize it with a...\r\n\r\n**Grumble!**\r\nA _satisfied_ \"grumble\" though, because I worked hard, I made progress, and learned new things.\r\nBut a \"grumble\" nonetheless, because tomorrow will be another full day of dragging this feature along.\r\nLet's hope I'll get it

where we've got to start!\r\n\r\nSome other changes, next to music and sound:\r\n\r\n- The \"Playbook\" top left is now \"real\" and connected;\r\n- The \"Run Playbook\" button will reset score and flippers;\r\n- The \"Your Score\" part has been better aligned with \"Score Targets\";\r\n- Basics for level medals and level progression are in place.\r\n\r\n### Alpha release then?\r\n\r\nSo one notable thing is _still_ missing: [Drag & Drop](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Forgs\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fprojects\u002F1\u002Fviews\u002F1).\r\nWhich actually is the core of the inner game loop.\r\nTogether with a few other bits it's the last thing missing for the alpha release.\r\nHere's a snapshot of [the Kanban

week.\r\nIf I'd pushed a bit harder this week, or would work a bunch over the weekend, I'd be able to finish it.\r\n\r\nBut I won't.\r\nIt's a hobby- and vacation project.\r\nIt's meant to be fun.\r\nAnd there's plenty of time left.\r\nSo I'm off for the weekend, and will continue on Monday where I left off.\r\n\r\nSee you

physics, and _maybe_ placeholder sound effects, we should close in on the alpha release.\r\nNice!\r\n\r\nNow excuse me while I run off to play some Lego Star Wars or Cascadia, and recharge for the

the foundations for the final app I encountered a super weird bug.\r\nThe ball would sometimes just jump off on its own.\r\nAnd sometimes it would \"sink\" into a platform.\r\n\r\nHere's what it the bug looks like (with some slow motion):\r\n\r\n[![animation of ball jumping up on its own](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-v1-20230315-physics-bugs.gif)](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-v1-20230315-physics-bugs.gif)\r\n\r\nAfter _hours_ of reading documentation, bisecting code, and debugging, I found the issue:\r\n**the texts and white rectangle to the _left_ of the machine can _sometimes_ cause the ball inside the machine to jump about**.\r\nAbsolutely nuts!\r\n\r\nSo I felt pretty unhappy about lost time.\r\nBut Annoyance made room for feeling relieved when I found a good minimal way to reproduce it.\r\n\r\nYet I was soon back to being even more salty again.\r\nHere's how.\r\nI wrote [a good reproducible scenario](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fjeroenheijmans\u002Frepro-godot-bounce-bug) and [GitHub issue for Godot](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fgodotengine\u002Fgodot\u002Fissues\u002F74940)\r\nA super short summary of the repro:\r\n\r\n- Create a specific (valid!) Node Tree\r\n- The tree involves combining GUI and Node2D nodes with physics\r\n- The presence of a white rectangle (!) next to the physics node, can affect if the physics _inside_ that node in weird ways\r\n\r\nHowever, I was informed in a one-sentence reply:\r\n\r\n\u003E I think this is not a bug, but **user error**.\r\n\r\nAhh, the good old \"_stupid user_\" excuse.\r\nBecause the wording straight up _blames_ the user for their problems.\r\n_They_ are in error.\r\nThis probably makes me extra salty because I've used that excuse myself in the past.\r\nAnd I'm now ashamed I used to do so.\r\n\r\nAnother user is slightly more friendly, but still also says:\r\n\r\n\u003E [This is not on] the engine [..., only] a **wrong expectation** [by you].\r\n\r\nWith a bit of empathy, the same meaning for both replies could be conveyed in a much friendlier way.\r\nPlus I _still_ think that it's reasonable to expect either the Editor or the Documentation to somehow help users avoid this pitfall.\r\nEspecially since behavior _inside_ a component was erratically affected by its siblings.\r\n\r\nThe second commenter ended with a bonus suggestion too:\r\n\r\n\u003E I recommend joining one of the communities to get feedback and support when looking for a solution and ending up with something that is not working.\r\n\r\nGuess that's a pretty strong hint that I should not be investing in any further interaction with Godot's GitHub community...\r\n\r\n### Happy\r\n\r\nEven through that loss of several hours, I still made some good progress!\r\nSo there's also reasons to be happy.\r\nAbove animated gif already showed it, here's also a still image of the current state of the game:\r\n\r\n[![Game screen with all components there](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-v1-20230315-snapshot.png)](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-v1-20230315-snapshot.png)\r\n\r\nLots of the basic interaction has been ported over from `prototype-007` as well.\r\nBut more importantly, the project and file structure are now well-organized and clean.\r\n\r\nI'm on schedule to have an alpha version of the game ready for _friendly_ testers near or shortly after the end of this week.\r\nAnd I'm pretty happy about that.\r\n\r\n### Next up\r\n\r\n[The GitHub Kanban Board](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Forgs\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fprojects\u002F1\u002Fviews\u002F1) will show you:\r\nthe alpha release is super-minimal.\r\nOnly the very basics are in there, and I'll use a User Test Script of sorts that fills in the gaps.\r\n\r\nSo (near) laser-focus on that alpha-release, is what's up next!\r\n";f.id="post-2023-03-14";f.isDraft=false;f.order=6;f.date=new Date(1678752000000);f.title="Day 30: Work In Progress";f.content="## Day 30: Work In Progress\r\n\r\n**_Jeroen_, March 14, 2023**\r\n\r\n[Yesterday](#post-2023-03-13) I started the day with a devlog.\r\nIt outlined the goals and plan for this current stretch.\r\nSince the end of yesterday you can now publicly track progress [on the GitHub Kanban Board](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Forgs\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fprojects\u002F1\u002Fviews\u002F1).\r\n\r\nToday I'm building the foundations of the final codebase, using `prototype-007` as a reference point.\r\nWhich involves a ton of struggling with Godot's haphazard UI layout features.\r\nSo there's little time for an extended devlog.\r\nThese few paragraphs will have to do, dear reader!\r\n\r\nCatch you tomorrow!\r\nI'm off to get a wee bit more productivity out of today.\r\n";g.id="post-2023-03-13";g.isDraft=false;g.order=7;g.date=new Date(1678665600000);g.title="Day 29: Planning";g.content="## Day 29: Planning\r\n\r\n**_Jeroen_, March 13, 2023**\r\n\r\n\u003E But Jeroen, isn't halfway into the project a bit late to create a plan!?\r\n\r\nWhy yes, it would be!\r\nBut: I already _had_ a plan, just not fully written down.\r\nAnd now that the end of my mini-sabbatical is nearing, and the plan is becoming fuzzy, it's time to revise it.\r\n\r\nToday I'm writing a devlog _fully_ at the _start_ of the day.\r\nAs I write, I'll create a plan for the remainder of the project.\r\nAfter that, I'll commit the rest of the day to taking the first steps.\r\n\r\n### Original plan\r\n\r\nSo, \"what was the 'original' not-written-down plan then?\", you may ask.\r\nWell, let's start with what I _did_ [write down at the start](#post-2023-02-16):\r\n\r\n[![early plans and brainstorm notes](\u002Fimg\u002Fv2023-02-14a-tipm-design-and-brainstorm.png)](\u002Fimg\u002Fv2023-02-14a-tipm-design-and-brainstorm.png)\r\n\r\nNote that the (respectively) pink and red highlighted items I considered most important.\r\nSo the plan was to:\r\n\r\n1. **Pick a name**, build a website + blog\r\n2. **Design and prototype** something, create primary sprites\r\n3. Set up something **temporary for sound and music**\r\n4. Create a **fun inner game loop**\r\n5. Learn the **game engine** needed for this\r\n6. Beta test it, **make sure it's _fun_** to play\r\n7. **Publish** and release to friends and family\r\n\r\nThe inner game loop would be:\r\n\r\n1. **Drag components around** to \"design\" a machine\r\n2. **Run the playbook** to see how it plays out\r\n\r\nThe secondary game loop:\r\n\r\n1. **Run the _inner_ game loop**\r\n2. **Check your score** and the medals you got\r\n3. **Unhappy**? Rinse and repeat. **Happy**? Go to next level.\r\n\r\nThe important thing is: **all of the above is still roughly relevant!**\r\nSo creating a fresh plan should be easy, right?!\r\n\r\n### Goals\r\n\r\nBefore talking about a plan, I need to talk about _goals_.\r\nLet's start with the _initial_ goals.\r\nWhen asked before the start, I'd say something like this:\r\n\r\n\u003E I develop software for a living.\r\n\u003E But I've never developed a _game_ before.\r\n\u003E So I want to try that.\r\n\u003E\r\n\u003E The goal would be to create one small game, end to end, nearly every part of it created by myself.\r\n\u003E And earn at least one euro with it, which can also be my own 1 euro: I just want to see what it takes to getting to _publishing_ a game.\r\n\r\nIt's also interesting to now what I did _not_ declare to be my goals:\r\n\r\n- That it should be a _good_ game;\r\n- That it should be a _successful_ game (monetarily or otherwise);\r\n- That it should be _completely_ finished;\r\n\r\nIt's _very_ tough to _not_ care about those things.\r\nAnd to be honest: I _do_ care about all three (in the order above).\r\n\r\nBut those things were _not_ my goals at the start.\r\nAnd I think that has remained unchanged.\r\nSo the main goals remain:\r\n\r\n- Experience what it's like to _develop_ a game;\r\n- Publish _something_ and earn at least one euro with it;\r\n\r\nKnowing my (unchanged) goals, it's time to create a fresh plan.\r\n\r\n### Revised plan\r\n\r\n[Prototype 007](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fprototype-007) after [Day 26](#post-2023-03-10) gives hope.\r\nIt should be good enough to help achieve above-stated goals.\r\nSo let's work from there.\r\nI should make it \"official\" too, and clean up a bit while doing so.\r\nThe first step should therefore be:\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 --\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003E 1. Move \"Prototype 007\" work over into the [core Pincrediball game repository](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fpincrediball).\r\n\u003E    Setting up a proper and clean project structure as I do so.\r\n\r\nAfter that I should basically have Prototype 007, but in a somewhat clean codebase.\r\nThe next steps would be to get to a playable state where I can ask friends to user test it.\r\nTo summarize:\r\n\r\n\u003E 2. Create a MUTeP: a Minimal User Testable Product.\r\n\u003E    Something that supports the _inner_ game loop.\r\n\u003E    Plus (possibly with workarounds) lets you imagine how the secondary game loop would work.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I just made the \"MUTeP\" acronym up.\r\n\r\nAfter getting test feedback, things shake up a bit.\r\nWho knows what testers will tell me?\r\nAnd what changes they require, affecting the plan.\r\nRegardless, the next step should be clear:\r\n\r\n\u003E 3. Handle feedback.\r\n\u003E    Fix the most glaring problems _that obstruct the end goals_.\r\n\u003E    Park all other suggestions and problems for the longer term.\r\n\r\nAfter this some extra feedback rounds may continue.\r\nBut looking at the main goals, the prime path to them has another focus.\r\nAt this point I should focus on making sure that _I myself_ am happy enough:\r\n\r\n\u003E 4. Make it publishable.\r\n\u003E    Make it good enough that I'm willing and happy (enough) to put it up on the web.\r\n\u003E    Including enough polish to make it presentable, without polishing forever.\r\n\r\nOriginally I thought I'd publish mainly (or even only) on Steam.\r\nBut I'm changing that a bit.\r\nI'm aiming to publish an alpha version with disclaimers on Itch.io first.\r\nAnd I'ld be happy with merely a wish-list page for Steam.\r\nIn short, the final step for during my mini-sabbatical would be:\r\n\r\n\u003E 5. Publish an early-access version.\r\n\u003E    Can be anywhere, as long as people can pay me an euro for it.\r\n\u003E    So that I might buy my own game, and accomplish the original goals.\r\n\r\nIt _feels_ possible to make these 5 steps in the remaining weeks.\r\nAnd it would feel great to do so, because I love the dopamine hit from achieving goals I set for myself.\r\n\r\nSo there you have it, that's the plan!\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- markdownlint-enable MD029 --\u003E\r\n\r\n### Beyond the plan\r\n\r\nMy aim with the aforementioned plan is to achieve the initial goals.\r\nThere are goals _beyond_ those.\r\nThere's two layers of goals:\r\n\r\n1. _Complete_ the game and make it _good_ enough for my own tastes.\r\n   And then also publish it on Steam.\r\n\r\n2. Try to make it a _success_.\r\n   Which includes a ton of marketing and social media work.\r\n\r\n3. Go _beyond initial success_.\r\n   Dreaming big, there could be a version 2 of the game, which would be a proper version.\r\n   This could include a Kickstarter and\u002For trying to get extra help on the project.\r\n\r\nThese are in chronological order, but also in order of how likely they are to happen.\r\nThe first one is somewhat likely, as I already sunk the 100 euro's into Steam to be allowed to publish a game.\r\nBut even that goal I might skip.\r\n\r\nThe good news: I don't have to decide at the time of writing this.\r\nIn fact, **I need to stop writing and start building**.\r\nOtherwise I won't even be in a position to think about those extended plans.\r\n\r\nOff we go!\r\n\r\nPS.

Learn Godot's Drag & Drop system\r\n\u003E 2. Allow players to move at least _some_ components around\r\n\u003E 3. Learn about Scene Composition in Godot\r\n\u003E\r\n\u003E Plus: leave a little bit of energy to do some work on Saturday.\r\n\u003E I really need to make some plan for the last few weeks available to finish an alpha version.\r\n\r\nSo technically that's _four_ goals, I suppose?\r\nAlthough also technically I did parts of \"1\" already, as you can tell from [\u002Fresources#bookmarks--godot-game-engine](\u002Fresources#bookmarks--godot-game-engine).\r\n\r\nI will allow myself (at least) one more day to \"muddle around\" in [`prototype-007` code](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fprototype-007).\r\nAfter that I really should be thinking about a somewhat clean codebase for the target alpha release of the game.\r\n\r\nFor now, let me put down my writing hat, and take a few moments to work through those goals.\r\n\r\n_A few ~moments~ hours later..._\r\n\r\n### Drag and Drop\r\n\r\nWhelp, that wasn't trivial.\r\nAnd as I feared when I just switched to Godot, them introducing a new major version would provide some hurdles.\r\nSo [a tiny underscore issue](https:\u002F\u002Fgamedev.stackexchange.com\u002Fquestions\u002F204808\u002Fdrag-and-drop-differences-between-godot-3-and-4) cost me a good two hours.\r\n\r\nBut, even though a little less polished than I'd like, we do have some results:\r\n\r\n\u003Cvideo controls loop style=\"max-width: 530px\"\u003E\r\n  \u003Csource src=\"\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-007-part3.mp4\"

Drop goals for today.\r\nIn the process I learned enough about Scenes and composing them to keep me rolling.\r\n\r\n### Up Next\r\n\r\nI'll call the above state today's check point.\r\nMaybe I'll do a few small things tonight.\r\nPossibly I'll do some work on Saturday.\r\nBut for now...\r\n\r\nSigning off!\r\n";j.id="post-2023-03-09";j.isDraft=false;j.order=10;j.date=new

this post, you must be a real fan!\r\n\r\n[Yesterday](#post-2023-03-08) led to some very tangible success.\r\nAs foreshadowed at the end of that post, today will be a shorter day.\r\nSo I was planning to spend some time on **research, instead of development**.\r\n\r\nMy plans include:\r\n\r\n- Structuring Research I've already done\r\n- Organizing my own glossary\r\n- Researching \"The Competition\" (other Pinball software and games)\r\n\r\nLet's get to the results, shall we!?\r\n\r\n### Structuring Research\r\n\r\nI've already built up a long list of online resources I've used so far.\r\nHigh time to put this into a better, version controlled format!\r\n\r\nThe main part of my saved research consists of... **bookmarks**!\r\nLet's keep it simple for now, and just integrate the most interesting ones with this website.\r\nSo without any ado:\r\n\r\nFind them all at [pincrediball.com\u002Fresources#bookmarks](\u002Fresources#bookmarks)!\r\n\r\n### Pinball Glossary\r\n\r\nIn my research I've found several glossaries for Pinball.\r\nNone of them summarize things in a way that suit me.\r\nSo it makes sense to create my own.\r\n\r\nSame holds here as for the \"Research\".\r\nIt makes the most sense (for now) to just add it to the website.\r\nSo, without any ado:\r\n\r\nFind the glossary at [pincrediball.com\u002Fresources#glossary](\u002Fresources#glossary)!\r\n\r\n### Researching \"The Competition\"\r\n\r\nIf there _are_ any direct competitors, I might as well check them out.\r\nMost likely there _will_ be software to create (and possibly also play) Pinball machines, which I also want to check out.\r\nIf there's time I might check some more general Pinball games.\r\n\r\nThis item was _last_ in my list, for good reason.\r\nIt's super open-ended, and could take hours, but also days or weeks!\r\n\r\nIn fact, this goal I've missed for today.\r\nI'll put it into the (forthcoming) blog post on all sorts of random ideas I still have.\r\nBut for now: there's not much more to say.\r\n\r\n### Summarizing\r\n\r\nRight.\r\nShort days are short.\r\nShorter even than you'd think.\r\nAnd I _really_ want to wrap up this post, _before_ I leave for social engagements.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'll revisit this post and the linked resources later in the day.\r\nBut most likely... _this will be it_.\r\nAnd tomorrow should be another day of actual _development_ work.\r\n\r\nUntil then!\r\n";k.id="post-2023-03-08";k.isDraft=false;k.order=11;k.date=new Date(1678233600000);k.title="Day 24: Implementing the Tutorial Machine";k.content="## Day 24: Implementing

own game.\r\nEnough to get me past my original hesitation to research how (un)original my game idea is.\r\nAnd what I can _learn_ from those other games, of course.\r\n\r\nI really _must_ park that, if even for a day.\r\nAnd focus on the original goals.\r\nMore precisely specified, let me say out loud that today I aim to:\r\n\r\n1. Get at least the _sprites_ in my game for all Tutorial elements;\r\n2. Get _behavior_ in for round bumpers;\r\n3. Stretch goal: get behavior in for slings;\r\n\r\nI'm gonna \"state my goals publicly\" again.\r\nThis time I'll do so by pushing relevant commits to GitHub early.\r\nI could use the method I introduced earlier ([with \"(DRAFT)\" in the title](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fpincrediball.com\u002Fcommit\u002F2d1051a9ab69d92104472ea5e7469d9fd2c3a89b#diff-49d919cc2693b0e3ba9a5cca314294b09fde3e8a1787c4f57a7c658b61fc5092)),\r\nbut today I'll just go with the simpler \"not yet running `npm run build` yet\".\r\n\r\nAt this point it is time to get coding!\r\n\r\n_A few ~moments~ hours later..._\r\n\r\n### Results!\r\n\r\nThat went better than expected!\r\nGot all sprites (except the rails) in the game.\r\nAlso got _base_ behavior in there for nearly all of them.\r\n\r\nHere's a good recording of where it stands right now:\r\n\r\n\u003Cvideo controls loop style=\"max-width: 530px\"\u003E\r\n  \u003Csource src=\"\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-007-part2.mp4\" type=\"video\u002Fmp4\" \u002F\u003E\r\n  Video recording the Tutorial Pinball Machine, layer for layer appearing\r\n\u003C\u002Fvideo\u003E\r\n\r\nIt's just insanely fun to watch a \"_multi-multi-multi-ball_\" going.\r\nReally that has to become part of the final game somehow.\r\nIf only as a \"victory dance\" after getting the gold medal.\r\n\r\nI'm quite excited about these results!\r\nEven though it becomes more clear that this mini-sabbatical is not long enough to complete my entire idea,\r\nI am certainly enjoying myself and learning a ton.\r\nSo I'll happily chug along.\r\n\r\n### Next up\r\n\r\nTomorrow will be a day with some social engagements.\r\nSo perfect for some light in-between work.\r\nPerhaps some research, and a summary on the devlog.\r\n\r\nFor continued work on the game and more fancy recordings:\r\nstay tuned for later in the week!\r\n";l.id="post-2023-03-07";l.isDraft=false;l.order=12;l.date=new Date(1678147200000);l.title="Day 23: Designing the Tutorial Machine";l.content="## Day 23: Designing the Tutorial Machine\r\n\r\n**_Jeroen_, March 07, 2023**\r\n\r\n[Yesterday](#post-2023-03-06) was an \"XXL\" day.\r\nFinished very late as well.\r\nSo today I'll go a little easier.\r\n\r\n### First half of a blog post\r\n\r\nHere's the goal for today:\r\n\r\n1. Design a \"finished\" tutorial machine.\r\n\r\nThat's it.\r\nJust one goal for today.\r\nI'm starting by writing this first half of the blog post.\r\nTo gather thoughts and set my goals.\r\nBecause that part did work well, yesterday.\r\n\r\nHere's my thoughts on switching back to \"Designing\" for a bit.\r\n**First up**, I _enjoyed_ doing the designs.\r\nSo it's easy to stay motivated this way.\r\n\r\n**Second**, it will _fixate scope_ for the Pinball Machine components of the Tutorial stage.\r\nSo it should help me keep things small (enough).\r\nAnd free up some mental space, once those things are \"on paper\".\r\n\r\n**Third**, and most importantly:\r\nit should help me _flesh out the core game concepts_.\r\nThe Tutorial machine should \"proof\" that the game loops are _fun_.\r\nOr it will _disproof_ that, and allow me to pivot if needed.\r\n\r\nSo, without further ado, let me get to creating those designs...\r\n\r\n..._a few ~moments~ hours later_:\r\n\r\n### Second half of a blog post\r\n\r\nWe're at the end of the day, and there's _some_ result.\r\nNot entirely happy yet, but \"good enough\" for now.\r\n\r\nDecided to \"work backwards\" with level design.\r\nFirst I designed _one configuration_ of the tutorial stage that finishes the last level with at least bronze.\r\nHere's the completed machine, as it's built up from the ground:\r\n\r\n\u003Cvideo controls loop style=\"max-width: 530px\"\u003E\r\n  \u003Csource src=\"\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-007-design-buildup.mp4\" type=\"video\u002Fmp4\" \u002F\u003E\r\n  Video recording the Tutorial Pinball Machine, layer for layer appearing\r\n\u003C\u002Fvideo\u003E\r\n\r\nOuter bounds and background artwork will always be visible to the player.\r\nComponents can be placed nearly anywhere on the field.\r\nThe artwork is supposed to be a guided tutorial for where things could have a nice placement.\r\n\r\nQuests (if ever) can be added to the tutorial by just completing the various goals a set number of time.\r\nThe center artwork could just light up more firmly for each achieved goal.\r\nAnd perhaps increase the multiplier for scores by doing so?\r\n\r\nNext day(s) I will try to move all these components into Godot.\r\nProgramming their features as I go along.\r\nAt some point the entire pinball machine should be \"done\".\r\nI guess if I add keybindings for the flippers I will have made a basic flipper game?\r\n\r\nAfter that I'm planning to add the actual core features:\r\nplayers can move around components, then run playbooks to achieve high scores.\r\nI'm sure to run into design troubles at that stage.\r\n\r\nBut for now, this result will have to do!\r\n\r\n### Summarizing\r\n\r\nA limited goal for the day, and that worked out just fine!\r\nModerately happy with this result, even though I guess all I did was \"_design a mediocre Pinball Machine_\".\r\nCurious to see if I can _at least_ turn that into a _working_ \"mediocre Pinball game\"...\r\n";m.id="post-2023-03-06";m.isDraft=false;m.order=13;m.date=new Date(1678060800000);m.title="Day 22: Prototype 007 (XXL devlog)";m.content="## Day 22: Prototype 007 (XXL devlog)\r\n\r\n**_Jeroen_, March 06, 2023**\r\n\r\nFresh week, fresh energy.\r\nStarted the week by [committing \"publicly\" (on Mastodon) to three small goals for today](https:\u002F\u002Fmastodon.social\u002F@jeroenheijmans\u002F109975463331122581):\r\n\r\n\u003E 1.

We're about to dive deep.\r\n\r\n### 1. Designing the tutorial machine\r\n\r\nDesigning Pinball machines is a skill on its own.\r\nI have no such skill, but I've tried to do a base level of research.\r\nAmongst others, having checked [several PAPAPinball YouTube \"Machine Tutorials\"](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=XSw7fK6x1mw&list=PL-WQLGFMr97CQpOQDEvRqAiSqcvSuK11h&index=3)\r\nI see several aspects of a good Pinball machine:\r\n\r\n- **Theme** that's appealing (often tied to an existing brand, like \"Batman\" or \"Jurassic Park\");\r\n- **Backplate** with artwork around the theme;\r\n- **Quests**: hitting specific targets in specific orders, in a way that's also fun and challenging;\r\n- **Toys** are extra-special (often gimicky and theme-related) components of the machine that do something crazy when hit;\r\n- **Balance** between how hard goals are to hit (and how big a chance you have to drain the ball), and how many points they give;\r\n- [**Flipper tricks**](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=r_7TQ6wRZdw&list=PL-WQLGFMr97DnxeE1Rmi-wAwa-Vm7D-7i) should allow skilled players to be better at the game;\r\n- **Multi-ball** mode is usually a goal to work towards, preferably when **\"multipliers\"** are enabled;\r\n- **Basic components** that _must_ be included:\r\n  plunger (with plunger lane and a gate),\r\n  flippers,\r\n  balls,\r\n  lanes,\r\n  spinners,\r\n  bumpers,\r\n  drop targets,\r\n  slingshots,\r\n  and rollovers.\r\n- **Extra components** should probably also be included:\r\n  backbox and display,\r\n  outlanes,\r\n  ramps,\r\n  gates,\r\n  and kickbacks.\r\n- **Skill Shots** (plunging the initial ball at a particular speed to hit a particular target) are perfect for Pincrediball too.\r\n  Especially in the tutorial levels, the \"Playbook\" could contain a precise skill shot.\r\n  This makes it super fun to place the initial components in a very precise location.\r\n\r\nWe'll start with designing the theme, backplate, and quests.\r\nOne theme per \"stage\" of the game, so multiple levels are on the same theme.\r\nThe _Tutorial_ stage is up first.\r\nAlthough I don't have a good term or word for the theme yet, it'll revolve around:\r\n\r\n- Stick figures and a \"math\" paper background;\r\n- A limited color scheme with shades of blue, and some black and white;\r\n- Quests to build up a mini-comic lit up on the backplate;\r\n\r\nAt this point I'll stop writing out my thoughts on this blog post.\r\nIt's time to grab a tool to design the initial art!\r\n\r\n_...a few ~moments~ hours later_:\r\n\r\n[![Pinball machine in progress](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-007-figma.png)](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-007-figma.png)\r\n\r\nThis gives me something to work with!\r\nInteresting notes about the design:\r\n\r\n- The plunger lane includes an amber-colored gate that should be \"one-way\" for the ball;\r\n- The three gates at the top are for points, and to be placed by the player in the game to create high scores;\r\n- There's a tiny start for stick-figure art in the main area, which will indicate quest progress;\r\n- I'm a noob at Figma, yet still made it work decently well!\r\n\r\nI want to continue tweaking this design, but I _must_ move on.\r\nThere's still two goals left for today.\r\nTime for a quick break, and then on to the next part.\r\n\r\n### 2. Putting it into Godot\r\n\r\nFor some reason I figured that having SVG's in Figma would make it easy to import everything into Godot.\r\nI was half right.\r\nThe _wrong_ half.\r\n\r\nImporting the \"Art\" as textures was very easy.\r\n\r\nBut the important half was not so easy; perhaps more research is needed?\r\nI was hoping the SVG paths would be useful as collision shapes.\r\nEspecially the bezier curves seemed logical for a pinball machine.\r\nI set myself certain goals for today, and getting this bit perfect would hold me back.\r\n\r\nSo, I went the labor-intensive route.\r\nImporting the design of the machine in chunks from Figma.\r\nAnd after that... _manually tracing over those shapes again_, to create the collision polygons.\r\nSo...\r\n\r\n_...a few ~moments~ hours later_:\r\n\r\n[![Pinball machine in progress](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-007-godot.png)](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-007-godot.png)\r\n\r\nThat at least should work to some degree!\r\nLet's have a look, shall we?\r\n\r\n### 3. Allow plunging a ball\r\n\r\nTime to program a little bit of interactivity.\r\nThe plan was as follows:\r\n\r\n- A \"Plunge\" button that spawns a ball and shoots it into the field;\r\n- **Bonus:** Flippers that just constantly, well, flipper;\r\n\r\nAfter a bunch of trial and error;\r\nafter a ton of Godot 3.x to 4.0 translation;\r\nafter loads of debugging and tweaking;\r\nin short after...\r\n\r\n_...a few ~moments~ hours later_:\r\n\r\n\u003Cvideo controls loop\u003E\r\n  \u003Csource src=\"\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-007.mp4\" type=\"video\u002Fmp4\" \u002F\u003E\r\n  Video recording of a basic pinball machine and dozens of balls\r\n\u003C\u002Fvideo\u003E\r\n\r\nI have a ton of concerns still.\r\nMost notably if this will be deterministic enough for my core game idea.\r\nBut concerns be damned, **I'm pretty content with this result!**\r\n\r\n### Recap\r\n\r\nIn short, I achieved what I set out to do:\r\n(1) design a machine, (2) put it in Godot, and (3) have basic ball physics.\r\nSetting the goals at the start certainly helped.\r\nTomorrow I might go for a more free-form day, but soon after I'll certainly use this same trick again.\r\n\r\nIf you made it this far into my stream-of-consciousness post:\r\nI salute you!\r\nYou're the best.\r\n\r\nOn to the next bits!\r\n";n.id="post-2023-03-03";n.isDraft=false;n.order=14;n.date=new Date(1677801600000);n.title="Day 19: Rest day";n.content="## Day 19: Rest day\r\n\r\n**_Jeroen_, March 03, 2023**\r\n\r\nGot up an hour later than I wanted.\r\nEnjoyed a visit from a friend, preferred chatting over working on the project.\r\nSome spinning while watching Rick & Morty.\r\nAnd some LEGO Star War with the Mrs.\r\n\r\nIn short: not much game dev was done today.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I'll catch up over the weekend.\r\nOr maybe I'll just reboot next week.\r\nI'm fine with either, it's a _vacation_ project, after all.\r\nWe'll see!\r\n";o.id="post-2023-03-02";o.isDraft=false;o.order=15;o.date=new Date(1677715200000);o.title="Day 18: Prototype 006 with Godot";o.content="## Day 18: Prototype 006 with Godot\r\n\r\n**_Jeroen_, March 02, 2023**\r\n\r\nToday I followed advice from friends.\r\nGodot got several more recommendations.\r\nAnd right after I decided to take it for a spin, [Godot 4.0 was released](https:\u002F\u002Fgodotengine.org\u002Farticle\u002Fgodot-4-0-sets-sail\u002F).\r\n\r\n\u003E After 3+ years of breaking and rebuilding from the ground up, a complete core overhaul and a full engine rewrite: **Welcome to the start of Godot 4!**\r\n\r\nSo that's both good and bad.\r\nIt's nice that I join in right when a boost in new modern features is released.\r\n\r\nBut as I suspected, it's less nice that we're now in a state of limbo.\r\nDocumentation has warnings all over the place that they might still be out of date.\r\nOnline examples are thoroughly broken.\r\nAll forum posts and Q&A online still uses the 3.x way of things.\r\n\r\nBut if I download the 3.x LTS version, I'm learning obsolete skills from the get go.\r\nSo Godot 4.0 it was.\r\n\r\n### Prototype? Mini-game!\r\n\r\nI named it \"prototype 006\" and might still put the code online as such.\r\nBut I mainly set out to just build a tiny game with Godot.\r\n\r\nAs a teenager I'd lie on my back in my room, endlessly tossing a small ball in the air.\r\nThe goal?\r\nTo get as close to the ceiling as possible, _without_ actually hitting it.\r\n\r\nSo I made it into a tiny Godot game.\r\nReally wanted to make it playable in the browser, more on that in a second.\r\nFirst, an example of what it looks like:\r\n\r\n[![Animated gif of a ball bouncing in the air for score](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-006.gif)](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-006.gif)\r\n\r\nYou press `[SPACE]` or `[LEFT MOUSE BUTTON]` for 0 to 2000 milliseconds to send it flying up.\r\nThe higher you get, the more points you score.\r\nIf you hit the ceiling?\r\nZero points.\r\n\r\nActually fun to build.\r\nMostly without frustration.\r\nBetter than Phaser, certainly.\r\nThis is looking promising!\r\n\r\n### Godot exports\r\n\r\nThe actual exporting to platforms is a bit more finnicky.\r\nAndroid requires the SDK so I'm yet to try that.\r\niOS similarly likely needs special stuff.\r\n\r\nThe `.exe` Windows version was somehwat easy.\r\nIt includes the entire Godot engine though.\r\nSo my super-simple game becomes 45+ MB: not great.\r\n\r\nThe \"html5\" version is even worse.\r\nThe WASM file also clocks in at similar size.\r\nBut worse: it requires quite modern but certainly not ubiquitous Web Server headers.\r\nThe response from the Godot team was, understandably but frustratingly:\r\n[\"This is a Web Server problem that Web Servers should fix\"](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fgodotengine\u002Fgodot\u002Fissues\u002F69020#issuecomment-1324253401).\r\n\r\nIt seems that [support for needed headers](https:\u002F\u002Fstackoverflow.com\u002Fq\u002F68609682\u002F419956) won't easily work on GitHub Pages.\r\nSo no runnable version of the game on this devlog for now.\r\n\r\n### Now what?\r\n\r\nIt'd be really sad if my final game wouldn't run well in browsers.\r\nBoth a demo version on the website, as well as an itch.io version, would be problematic.\r\nBut I don't think I'll let that hold me back.\r\nTomorrow I'll sleep in, and at some point go back to toying with Godot.\r\nMainly because it was _fun_ to do so!\r\n";p.id="post-2023-03-01";p.isDraft=false;p.order=16;p.date=new Date(1677628800000);p.title="Day 17: Giving up";p.content="## Day 17: Giving up\r\n\r\n**_Jeroen_, March 01, 2023**\r\n\r\nI'm giving up.\r\n\r\nThe past few days have been extremely frustrating.\r\nI'm spending _days_ on trivial things like [making objects only movable by a player](https:\u002F\u002Fgamedev.stackexchange.com\u002Fquestions\u002F204691\u002Fhow-to-make-object-movable-only-by-the-player).\r\nIn those days I'm also loosing _hours_ on how utterly inconsistent and unpredictable the Phaser and Matter API are for nontrivial things.\r\n\r\nSummarizing those two things differently:\r\n\r\n1.

Phaser itself and its engine are frustrating to work with so far;\r\n\r\nSo I'm giving up.\r\nOn my current approach.\r\n\r\n### What now then?\r\n\r\nWell, I need to mentally reset.\r\nSo tomorrow I'll start with a completely fresh approach.\r\nNot sure which yet.\r\n\r\nTo end this day with a brainstorm of a few possible roads to take:\r\n\r\n- **Stick with Phaser and MatterJS?**\r\n  Still try to stay with Phaser, revitalize, and try to make Matter physics work for me?\r\n  Probably I should know better, given how frustrated I am right now.\r\n- **Stick with Phaser and a new Physics engine?**\r\n  Stay with Phaser, but see if there's a way to get **Box2D** to work with it?\r\n  I found [the Pinball(!) example](http:\u002F\u002Fphaser.io\u002Fexamples\u002Fv2\u002Fbox2d\u002Fpinball) but it was for the years old version 2 of Phaser.\r\n- **Try out Godot, or Unity?**\r\n  The main alternatives I'd consider (next to very maybe GameMaker).\r\n  I'm just super-worried that I first need a few weeks to learn them.\r\n- **Rolling my own engine?**\r\n  This seemed like a bad idea [after day 10](#post-2023-02-22).\r\n  But perhaps I should give it another go?\r\n- **Quit building, start (more) procrastination?**\r\n  To be honest, I've been enjoying everything _except_ building the damn game a lot.\r\n  The website, the socials, the designs, the (not-yet-existent) Kickstarter...\r\n  Perhaps I should embrace those first?\r\n- **Quit altogether?**\r\n  I have 4 out of 8 weeks left in my mini-sabbatical.\r\n  There's plenty of things to do in those weeks, other than building a game.\r\n\r\nAnd surely there are more options.\r\nI'll sleep on it, and decide when I'm fresh at it again.\r\nIt's not very likely that I'll \"Quit altogether\", but I'm keeping options open:\r\nfirst and foremost I want to be having fun.\r\nAnd, surprise: all through abovementioned frustration, I'm still having fun!\r\n\r\nBut for now, I need a break.\r\n";q.id="post-2023-02-28";q.isDraft=false;q.order=17;q.date=new Date(1677542400000);q.title="Day 16: Putting it all together";q.content="## Day 16: Putting it all together\r\n\r\n**_Jeroen_, February 28, 2023**\r\n\r\nSecond day of week 3, and although I _am_ pushing myself through _some_ relevant work, I'm not making the progress I wanted.\r\n\r\nHeck, I'm even writing this recap at the start of day 16.\r\nSo I'm keeping it short, so I can try once more to get some work in.\r\n\r\nWhat I did yesterday is to commit on a setup.\r\nI did not name my repository for the day `prototype-...`.\r\nNo, I actually started the main game repository.\r\nAnd I merged the best bits from earlier prototype.\r\n\r\nThat means the day after this one, there are really no excuses left.\r\nWork has to be done on the game.\r\nLet's get cracking!\r\n\r\nPS.

February 27, 2023**\r\n\r\nFirst day of week 3 of the project, day 15 of the project.\r\n\r\nI'm writing an early devlog today.\r\nAfter writing this I will probably _continue_ development.\r\nBut I feel like I reached a checkpoint _now_, so a recap is in order.\r\n\r\n### Prototype 004\r\n\r\nLooking at the overview of posts you may wonder: \"What happened to prototype 004?\".\r\nGlad you asked!\r\nIn fact, on [Day 12](#post-2023-02-24) I combined Phaser with Svelte;\r\nonly at the end of that day did I \"promote\" it to [its own prototype repository](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Forgs\u002Fpincrediball\u002Frepositories?q=prototype).\r\nQuite likely `prototype-004` will even grow into the end result at some point.\r\n\r\n### Ladies and Gentlemen: Prototype Number 005!\r\n\r\nSo, today I got up fresh and early.\r\nThe main problem to tackle: **some (more) determinism** in runs.\r\nOtherwise the core game loop (precisely placing parts so you get a high score) is no fun.\r\n\r\nDeterminism turns out to be quite difficult with MatterJS.\r\nBut that's only one problem.\r\nIt has no Continuous Collision Detection (CCD) either, causing the ball at high velocity to go _through_ walls.\r\nThis might get worse once I get to implementing flippers, I suspect.\r\nSo I was doubting my engine choice a bit.\r\n\r\nStill, after a productive morning, I found that things might be good enough for now.\r\nI tweaked the engine settings to a point where many parallel instances of my game would all give the same result.\r\nHere's [the \"proof\" of that](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fprototype-005):\r\n\r\n\u003Cvideo controls loop\u003E\r\n  \u003Csource

prototype made two things clear to me:\r\n\r\n- It gives enough _confidence_ to move forward with my current setup;\r\n- It causes enough _doubt_ that this engine should be the final choice for a _full_ game;\r\n\r\nIn short: a nice check point reached!\r\n\r\n### What's next?\r\n\r\nSo the next steps are to go \"all in\" on the current approach.\r\nMore specifically, my to do list is currently:\r\n\r\n- Design a good looking tutorial theme and pinball machine;\r\n- Integrate that design, Prototype 004, and Prototype nr. 5;\r\n- Allow the player to move bumpers around\r\n- Add flippers to the game;\r\n\r\nPerhaps a few sound effects to make working on this project a bit more fun too.\r\nI will roll up the rest of today's work in the next devlog entry either way.\r\nStay tuned!\r\n";s.id="post-2023-02-24";s.isDraft=false;s.order=19;s.date=new Date(1677196800000);s.title="Day 12: Combining Phaser and Svelte";s.content="## Day 12: Combining Phaser and Svelte\r\n\r\n**_Jeroen_, February 24, 2023**\r\n\r\nI'm back to integrating PhaserJS with the MatterJS physics engine, and Svelte.\r\nThe fourth prototype uses some of the domain entities from prototype-003.\r\nAnd it includes a Phaser scene for the actual Pinball machine.\r\n\r\nFor lack of time (the weekend calls for other obligations) I'll just use a static screenshot for the blog:\r\n\r\n[![Game in a browser window](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-004-part1.png)](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-004-part1.png)\r\n\r\nThe rest of today was spent on trying to make Matter more deterministic.\r\nAnd in that process I got (again) a bit side tracked with [an energy conservation issue](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fliabru\u002Fmatter-js\u002Fissues\u002F256#issuecomment-1443680697) with MatterJS.\r\n\r\nSo we close off this week with far less results than I'd hoped.\r\nFor a large part because I procrastinated and let myself get side tracked though.\r\nWhat all that does mean is that I need to re-evaluate my goals and approach next week.\r\n\r\nWhat's super important is that the machine becomes more deterministic.\r\nThe whole \"automata player\" and game loop idea falls apart if different runs of the automata have different outcomes.\r\nEither the setup needs to become (more) deterministic, or the game loop has to change.\r\nOr my goals for the project need to change...\r\n\r\nGot a weekend to chew on that though.\r\n";t.id="post-2023-02-23";t.isDraft=false;t.order=20;t.date=new Date(1677110400000);t.title="Day 11: Sidetracked with Markdown";t.content="## Day 11: Sidetracked with

joy to play around with something else.\r\nHere's what I changed up for this pincrediball.com's website source code.\r\n\r\n### Prose TailwindCSS plugin\r\n\r\nTailwind resets styling, so you can reliably create Web Applications and Sites.\r\nThat's all great, but for long-form textual content it's actually painful to loose _all_ styling.\r\n[The Tailwind \"Prose\" plugin](https:\u002F\u002Ftailwindcss.com\u002Fdocs\u002Ftypography-plugin) aims to solve that, without compromising the reset of styles that Tailwind gives you.\r\n\r\nIt was just fine to write this devlog straight up with html and Tailwind classes.\r\nBut copy-pasting things like `mt-4` on each `\u003Cp\u003E` becomes tedious pretty quickly.\r\nThe Prose plugin fixes that nicely, and cleaned up my devlog source code considerably.\r\n\r\n### Markdown for blogging\r\n\r\nThis also enables the next step.\r\nMarkdown is a far nicer format to write blogposts in.\r\nI had noticed before that [`svelte.dev` uses markdown for their blog](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fsveltejs\u002Fsites\u002Ftree\u002Fmaster\u002Fsites\u002Fsvelte.dev\u002Fcontent\u002Fblog),\r\nwhich sparked my interest.\r\n\r\nAfter briefly trying the (rather nice!) [svelte-exmarkdown](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fssssota\u002Fsvelte-exmarkdown) library, I decided I needed a bit more control.\r\nSo I dove a bit deeper into how `svelte.dev` does things.\r\nAnd that setup is quite nice indeed, as it includes support for SSR and RSS.\r\n\r\nSo, I used a (much) simplified variant of that setup.\r\nAnd: it works like a breeze!\r\nAdding a blog post can now be as simple as [adding one `.md` file to the repository](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fpincrediball.com\u002Fcommit\u002F22f4cb509b4c4fbe3b81eb4089af522c21a14bb5)!\r\n\r\n### What's next?\r\n\r\nThat's all nice!\r\nBut what's next?\r\nShould I ever feel like getting side-tracked again, there's a few things left to tweak:\r\n\r\n- RSS feed would be nice;\r\n- Having `[slug]` based pages might be nice;\r\n- GitHub Action to `npm run build` would be nice;\r\n- GitHub Action to deploy GH-Pages should be nice;\r\n\r\nBut for now: let's stop procrastination and get back to building the game.\r\nShall

the mountain of work became visible.\r\n\r\nThe smart thing to do?\r\nEnjoy a few other fun things in my sabbatical, let the project lie down for a bit.\r\nI'll likely revitalize my enthusiasm for the project and go back to using an existing engine.\r\nPossibly within this web app that's now set up.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for prototype _004_ soon (?).\r\nI'm calling it an early day, on Day

physics engine collisions into submission.\r\nAnd how much I should probably let go and embrace the chaos of a realistic engine.\r\n\r\nHowever, I still changed it up... for prototyping purposes!\r\n\r\nUsing PhaserJS and MatterJS might _still_ be the right way to go.\r\nBut I still wanted to try out how it feels to create a fully custom engine anyways.\r\n\r\nAnd while I was at that, I was also curious to see how far I can get with plain html, css, and JavaScript (and no _game_ engine).\r\nUsing SvelteKit and Tailwind, just for prototyping speed at the moment.\r\n\r\nI didn't get very far yet with writing the actual game loop and time ticker.\r\nBut I did do a bunch of good work on an initial game layout.\r\nIt's far from polished, but (even though polish might be 80% of the work?!) that's for later.\r\nHere's the initial results:\r\n\r\n[![Game in a browser window](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-003-part1a.png)](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-003-part1a.png)\r\n\r\nObviously, this still needs work.\r\nBut it's getting somewhere.\r\nEven if I go the PhaserJS route after all, I might be able to use this setup in conjunction with it.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm sorry to say: that's all for today, folks!\r\n\r\nAs a final footnote for today's devlog: I also decided to open source the prototypes.\r\nSo you can fully see me fumbling about.\r\nWriting all sorts of just-make-it-work code.\r\nYou can find [all the repositories in the Pincrediball GitHub organization](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball).\r\nAnd for my most loyal readers (hi mum!), here's a quick peek at it, with just a random screenshot of me hacking about in prototype number three!\r\n\r\n[![VSCode showing prototype-003 files](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-003-part1b.png)](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-003-part1b.png)\r\n\r\nPrototype 003 will likely get some more love the coming days.\r\nStay tuned!\r\n";w.id="post-2023-02-20";w.isDraft=false;w.order=23;w.date=new Date(1676851200000);w.title="Day 8: Prototype 002";w.content="## Day 8: Prototype 002\r\n\r\n**_Jeroen_, February 20, 2023**\r\n\r\nAfter not doing too much during the weekend (days 6 & 7), it's now Monday of week 2 and high time to get back to the project.\r\nAfter a week of \"meta\" stuff, designing, and a super-light prototype, today was spent on more in-depth prototyping.\r\n\r\nI'm very happy with what I _did_, but only moderately so with the _result_.\r\nHere, have a look for yourself first:\r\n\r\n\u003Cvideo controls loop\u003E\r\n  \u003Csource src=\"\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-002.mp4\" type=\"video\u002Fmp4\" \u002F\u003E\r\n  Video recording of an extremely crude demo pinball machine.\r\n\u003C\u002Fvideo\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Csmall\u003E(Note that you see the debug boxes and vectors in these prototypes.)\u003C\u002Fsmall\u003E\r\n\r\nLet's summarize what I learned during today's experiments, starting with the positives:\r\n\r\n- ✅ SvelteKit will be a great \"bearer\" of the game\r\n- ✅ Using plain html\u002Fcss\u002Fjs for parts of the app will likely turn out great\r\n- ✅ Tailwind enables for fast menu's and other UI\r\n- ✅ I got _something_ looking like Pinball physics to work\r\n\r\nHowever, I have many concerns after today:\r\n\r\n- ❌ MatterJS physics is wonky ls going _through_ static bounds or getting stuck\r\n- ❌ Level editing is cumbersome in (vanilla) Phaser, without any tools\r\n- ❌ Curved shapes and SVG paths are a _major_ pain to use\r\n\r\nI'm not so sure yet where to go from here.\r\nHave I learned that I need to go back to my original idea?\r\nBuilding a super-simple physics engine of my own, to make everything far more deterministic and reliable?\r\nOr should I stick with out-of-the-box physics and just deal with the issues?\r\n\r\nPerhaps a night's sleep and some distraction will bring clarity.\r\n";x.id="post-2023-02-17";x.isDraft=false;x.order=24;x.date=new Date(1676592000000);x.title="Day 5: Prototype

a very first prototype with a plunger and a ball, plus some physics:\r\n\r\n\u003Cvideo controls loop\u003E\r\n  \u003Csource\r\n    src=\"\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-001.webm\"\r\n

extremely crude demo pinball machine.\r\n\u003C\u002Fvideo\u003E\r\n\r\nIt seems the choice for PhaserJS with the MatterJS physics engine is \"good enough\" for my goals.\r\nAnd I think I will just leave it to chance that I chose right, instead of heavily investigating other Game Engines.\r\n\r\nThat's it for day 5.\r\nWeekend's up next, we'll see if I continue work, or whether the next update will come on Monday...\r\n";y.id="post-2023-02-16";y.isDraft=false;y.order=25;y.date=new Date(1676505600000);y.title="Day 4: Engine's on!";y.content="## Day 4: Engine's on!\r\n\r\n**_Jeroen_, February 16, 2023**\r\n\r\nToday it's time to figure out an engine to use.\r\nI'm leaning heavily towards [PhaserJS](https:\u002F\u002Fphaser.io\u002F) (the main alternatives being Godot and Unity),\r\nbecause it allows me to tap into my existing web development and JavaScript skills.\r\n\r\nI'm mostly doing tutorials and reading documentation, so no exciting updates from today for the devlog.\r\nThat does give me a minute to share my rough \"plan\" I created earlier in the project.\r\nHere it is:\r\n\r\n[![Brainstorm overview divided in 6 sections: Design, Graphics\u002FArt, Sound\u002FMusic, Game Loop\u002FEngine, Polish, Publish](\u002Fimg\u002Fv2023-02-14a-tipm-brainstorm.png)](\u002Fimg\u002Fv2023-02-14a-tipm-brainstorm.png)\r\n\r\nIt started as a brainstorm, but it became a rough \"plan\".\r\nEach of the six parts is roughly a time box of one week.\r\nI'm starting with \"Design\" this week, but currently borrowing a bit from the next goal: \"Game Loop \u002F Engine\".\r\n\r\nStuff's color coded too: the red stuff is Must-Haves, yellow Should-Haves, and green the Nice-to-Haves.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\nToo optimistic?\r\nProbably.\r\nBut let's see how far we'll get, shall we?!\r\n";z.id="post-2023-02-15";z.isDraft=false;z.order=26;z.date=new Date(1676419200000);z.title="Day 3: Website first?";z.content="## Day 3: Website first?\r\n\r\n**_Jeroen_, February 15, 2023**\r\n\r\nContinuing from day 2 with a focus on _fun_ activities, I decided to finish up the website.\r\nThis time I don't think I can claim anymore that it's in the end somehow part of the _critical path_ though?\r\n\r\nBut regardless of whether it was _The Right Thing_ to do right now, it _was_ very effective!\r\nI mean: you're looking at the very result right now.\r\n\r\nThe website was built with SvelteKit and TailwindCSS, which was rather efficient because I recently used it for both of my other recent side-projects:\r\n[Tierdom](https:\u002F\u002Ftierdom.jeroenheijmans.nl) and [vesta.infi.nl](https:\u002F\u002Fvesta.infi.nl).\r\nBut not before I spent the entire morning learning some more Figma skills to do the entire design first.\r\n\r\nI only bought the domain name, used\r\n[GitHub pages with a custom and apex domain](https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.github.com\u002Fen\u002Fpages\u002Fconfiguring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site\u002Fabout-custom-domains-and-github-pages#using-an-apex-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)\r\nfor hosting the whole thing.\r\nWhich, after the usual DNS hassle, works quite well!\r\n\r\nAll this means three important things:\r\n\r\n- I can _comfortably share_ the plans with the world\r\n- I am _on schedule_ for week 1's plans\r\n- I have _no excuses left_ to procrastinate prototyping\r\n\r\nSo let's end this third day with some initial social media posts and links to this website.\r\n\r\n**And tomorrow: we prototype!**\r\n";A.id="post-2023-02-14";A.isDraft=false;A.order=27;A.date=new Date(1676332800000);A.title="Day 2: Now we're getting somewhere!";A.content="## Day 2: Now we're getting somewhere!\r\n\r\n**_Jeroen_, February 14, 2023**\r\n\r\nSecond day I allowed myself to get side-tracked.\r\nI decided that the best way to keep motivation high was by _doing essential things disguised as non-essential things_.\r\nBy this I mean I tried to incorporate essential things (work on the designs and game idea) into far less essential things (that were enjoyable to do).\r\n\r\nFirst thing I did was to **redo the main game screen's design**.\r\nFor fun I've shared that on the (current, at the time of writing) [home page](\u002F).\r\nAfter that I took care of a bunch of other non-essential (but fun!) things:\r\n\r\n- ✅ Logo &amp; Banner designed\r\n- ✅ YouTube channel claimed\r\n- ✅ Itch.io account claimed\r\n- ✅ Socials set up\r\n- ✅ SteamWorks application submitted (and $100 fee paid...)\r\n\r\nIt was a _fun_ day with this too, as you can tell from [my related toot](https:\u002F\u002Fmastodon.social\u002F@jeroenheijmans\u002F109865321998439644).\r\nAnd it really gave me a bunch of inspiration and energy to continue on!\r\n";B.id="post-2023-02-13";B.isDraft=false;B.order=28;B.date=new Date(1676246400000);B.title="Day 1: Gotta start

Super Bowl... in the GMT+1 timezone!\r\nSo was up until 04:30 (that's AM for y'all), naturally this wasn't the most productive day.\r\n\r\nBut the most important thing got done: I got _started_ on the project!\r\nPlus several important things got done nonetheless, as [I wrote on Mastodon](https:\u002F\u002Fmastodon.social\u002F@jeroenheijmans\u002F109859902264743330):\r\n\r\n- ✅ Brainstorm
