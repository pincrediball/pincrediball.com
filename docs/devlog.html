<h3 id="jeroen-march-02-2023"><strong>Jeroen</strong>, March 02, 2023</h3>
<p>Today I followed advice from friends.
Godot got several more recommendations.
And right after I decided to take it for a spin, <a target="_blank" href='https://godotengine.org/article/godot-4-0-sets-sail/'>Godot 4.0 was released</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After 3+ years of breaking and rebuilding from the ground up, a complete core overhaul and a full engine rewrite: <strong>Welcome to the start of Godot 4!</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that&#39;s both good and bad.
It&#39;s nice that I join in right when a boost in new modern features is released.</p>
<p>But as I suspected, it&#39;s less nice that we&#39;re now in a state of limbo.
Documentation has warnings all over the place that they might still be out of date.
Online examples are thoroughly broken.
All forum posts and Q&amp;A online still uses the 3.x way of things.</p>
<p>But if I download the 3.x LTS version, I&#39;m learning obsolete skills from the get go.
So Godot 4.0 it was.</p>
<h4 id="prototype-mini-game">Prototype? Mini-game!</h4>
<p>I named it &quot;prototype 006&quot; and might still put the code online as such.
But I mainly set out to just build a tiny game with Godot.</p>
<p>As a teenager I&#39;d lie on my back in my room, endlessly tossing a small ball in the air.
The goal?
To get as close to the ceiling as possible, <em>without</em> actually hitting it.</p>
<p>So I made it into a tiny Godot game.
Really wanted to make it playable in the browser, more on that in a second.
First, an example of what it looks like:</p>
<p><a href="/img/pincrediball-prototype-006.gif"><img src="/img/pincrediball-prototype-006.gif" alt="Animated gif of a ball bouncing in the air for score"></a></p>
<p>You press <code>[SPACE]</code> or <code>[LEFT MOUSE BUTTON]</code> for 0 to 2000 milliseconds to send it flying up.
The higher you get, the more points you score.
If you hit the ceiling?
Zero points.</p>
<p>Actually fun to build.
Mostly without frustration.
Better than Phaser, certainly.
This is looking promising!</p>
<h4 id="godot-exports">Godot exports</h4>
<p>The actual exporting to platforms is a bit more finnicky.
Android requires the SDK so I&#39;m yet to try that.
iOS similarly likely needs special stuff.</p>
<p>The <code>.exe</code> Windows version was somehwat easy.
It includes the entire Godot engine though.
So my super-simple game becomes 45+ MB: not great.</p>
<p>The &quot;html5&quot; version is even worse.
The WASM file also clocks in at similar size.
But worse: it requires quite modern but certainly not ubiquitous Web Server headers.
The response from the Godot team was, understandably but frustratingly:
<a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/69020#issuecomment-1324253401'>&quot;This is a Web Server problem that Web Servers should fix&quot;</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>.</p>
<p>It seems that <a target="_blank" href='https://stackoverflow.com/q/68609682/419956'>support for needed headers</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a> won&#39;t easily work on GitHub Pages.
So no runnable version of the game on this devlog for now.</p>
<h4 id="now-what">Now what?</h4>
<p>It&#39;d be really sad if my final game wouldn&#39;t run well in browsers.
Both a demo version on the website, as well as an itch.io version, would be problematic.
But I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll let that hold me back.
Tomorrow I&#39;ll sleep in, and at some point go back to toying with Godot.
Mainly because it was <em>fun</em> to do so!</p>

<h3 id="jeroen-march-01-2023"><strong>Jeroen</strong>, March 01, 2023</h3>
<p>I&#39;m giving up.</p>
<p>The past few days have been extremely frustrating.
I&#39;m spending <em>days</em> on trivial things like <a target="_blank" href='https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/204691/how-to-make-object-movable-only-by-the-player'>making objects only movable by a player</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>.
In those days I&#39;m also loosing <em>hours</em> on how utterly inconsistent and unpredictable the Phaser and Matter API are for nontrivial things.</p>
<p>Summarizing those two things differently:</p>
<ol>
<li>Core Pincrediball concepts are nontrivial in Phaser&#39;s physics engine;</li>
<li>Phaser itself and its engine are frustrating to work with so far;</li>
</ol>
<p>So I&#39;m giving up.
On my current approach.</p>
<h4 id="what-now-then">What now then?</h4>
<p>Well, I need to mentally reset.
So tomorrow I&#39;ll start with a completely fresh approach.
Not sure which yet.</p>
<p>To end this day with a brainstorm of a few possible roads to take:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stick with Phaser and MatterJS?</strong>
Still try to stay with Phaser, revitalize, and try to make Matter physics work for me?
Probably I should know better, given how frustrated I am right now.</li>
<li><strong>Stick with Phaser and a new Physics engine?</strong>
Stay with Phaser, but see if there&#39;s a way to get <strong>Box2D</strong> to work with it?
I found <a target="_blank" href='http://phaser.io/examples/v2/box2d/pinball'>the Pinball(!) example</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a> but it was for the years old version 2 of Phaser.</li>
<li><strong>Try out Godot, or Unity?</strong>
The main alternatives I&#39;d consider (next to very maybe GameMaker).
I&#39;m just super-worried that I first need a few weeks to learn them.</li>
<li><strong>Rolling my own engine?</strong>
This seemed like a bad idea <a href="#post-2023-02-22">after day 10</a>.
But perhaps I should give it another go?</li>
<li><strong>Quit building, start (more) procrastination?</strong>
To be honest, I&#39;ve been enjoying everything <em>except</em> building the damn game a lot.
The website, the socials, the designs, the (not-yet-existent) Kickstarter...
Perhaps I should embrace those first?</li>
<li><strong>Quit altogether?</strong>
I have 4 out of 8 weeks left in my mini-sabbatical.
There&#39;s plenty of things to do in those weeks, other than building a game.</li>
</ul>
<p>And surely there are more options.
I&#39;ll sleep on it, and decide when I&#39;m fresh at it again.
It&#39;s not very likely that I&#39;ll &quot;Quit altogether&quot;, but I&#39;m keeping options open:
first and foremost I want to be having fun.
And, surprise: all through abovementioned frustration, I&#39;m still having fun!</p>
<p>But for now, I need a break.</p>

<h3 id="jeroen-february-28-2023"><strong>Jeroen</strong>, February 28, 2023</h3>
<p>Second day of week 3, and although I <em>am</em> pushing myself through <em>some</em> relevant work, I&#39;m not making the progress I wanted.</p>
<p>Heck, I&#39;m even writing this recap at the start of day 16.
So I&#39;m keeping it short, so I can try once more to get some work in.</p>
<p>What I did yesterday is to commit on a setup.
I did not name my repository for the day <code>prototype-...</code>.
No, I actually started the main game repository.
And I merged the best bits from earlier prototype.</p>
<p>That means the day after this one, there are really no excuses left.
Work has to be done on the game.
Let&#39;s get cracking!</p>
<p>PS. When I procrastinate I try to
watch <a target="_blank" href='https://www.youtube.com/@ourcadetv'>great Phaser tutorials</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>
or <a target="_blank" href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMPyTqiot4'>Real Life Pinball Machine Tutorials</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>
(yes, that&#39;s a thing...). You might enjoy those too?</p>

        <hr class="my-8 border-t border-t-amber-400/25"><article id="post-2023-02-27" class="scroll-mt-24 prose prose-invert max-w-none"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><h2 id="day-15-prototype-005">Day 15: Prototype 005</h2>
<h3 id="jeroen-february-27-2023"><strong>Jeroen</strong>, February 27, 2023</h3>
<p>First day of week 3 of the project, day 15 of the project.</p>
<p>I&#39;m writing an early devlog today.
After writing this I will probably <em>continue</em> development.
But I feel like I reached a checkpoint <em>now</em>, so a recap is in order.</p>
<h4 id="prototype-004">Prototype 004</h4>
<p>Looking at the overview of posts you may wonder: &quot;What happened to prototype 004?&quot;.
Glad you asked!
In fact, on <a href="#post-2023-02-24">Day 12</a> I combined Phaser with Svelte;
only at the end of that day did I &quot;promote&quot; it to <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/orgs/pincrediball/repositories?q=prototype'>its own prototype repository</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>.
Quite likely <code>prototype-004</code> will even grow into the end result at some point.</p>
<h4 id="ladies-and-gentlemen-prototype-number-005">Ladies and Gentlemen: Prototype Number 005!</h4>
<p>So, today I got up fresh and early.
The main problem to tackle: <strong>some (more) determinism</strong> in runs.
Otherwise the core game loop (precisely placing parts so you get a high score) is no fun.</p>
<p>Determinism turns out to be quite difficult with MatterJS.
But that&#39;s only one problem.
It has no Continuous Collision Detection (CCD) either, causing the ball at high velocity to go <em>through</em> walls.
This might get worse once I get to implementing flippers, I suspect.
So I was doubting my engine choice a bit.</p>
<p>Still, after a productive morning, I found that things might be good enough for now.
I tweaked the engine settings to a point where many parallel instances of my game would all give the same result.
Here&#39;s <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/pincrediball/prototype-005'>the &quot;proof&quot; of that</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>:</p>
<video controls loop>
  <source src="/img/pincrediball-prototype-005.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Video recording of an extremely crude demo pinball machine.
</video>

<p>This prototype made two things clear to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>It gives enough <em>confidence</em> to move forward with my current setup;</li>
<li>It causes enough <em>doubt</em> that this engine should be the final choice for a <em>full</em> game;</li>
</ul>
<p>In short: a nice check point reached!</p>
<h4 id="whats-next">What&#39;s next?</h4>
<p>So the next steps are to go &quot;all in&quot; on the current approach.
More specifically, my to do list is currently:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design a good looking tutorial theme and pinball machine;</li>
<li>Integrate that design, Prototype 004, and Prototype nr. 5;</li>
<li>Allow the player to move bumpers around</li>
<li>Add flippers to the game;</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps a few sound effects to make working on this project a bit more fun too.
I will roll up the rest of today&#39;s work in the next devlog entry either way.
Stay tuned!</p>

<h3 id="jeroen-february-24-2023"><strong>Jeroen</strong>, February 24, 2023</h3>
<p>I&#39;m back to integrating PhaserJS with the MatterJS physics engine, and Svelte.
The fourth prototype uses some of the domain entities from prototype-003.
And it includes a Phaser scene for the actual Pinball machine.</p>
<p>For lack of time (the weekend calls for other obligations) I&#39;ll just use a static screenshot for the blog:</p>
<p><a href="/img/pincrediball-prototype-004-part1.png"><img src="/img/pincrediball-prototype-004-part1.png" alt="Game in a browser window"></a></p>
<p>The rest of today was spent on trying to make Matter more deterministic.
And in that process I got (again) a bit side tracked with <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/liabru/matter-js/issues/256#issuecomment-1443680697'>an energy conservation issue</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a> with MatterJS.</p>
<p>So we close off this week with far less results than I&#39;d hoped.
For a large part because I procrastinated and let myself get side tracked though.
What all that does mean is that I need to re-evaluate my goals and approach next week.</p>
<p>What&#39;s super important is that the machine becomes more deterministic.
The whole &quot;automata player&quot; and game loop idea falls apart if different runs of the automata have different outcomes.
Either the setup needs to become (more) deterministic, or the game loop has to change.
Or my goals for the project need to change...</p>
<p>Got a weekend to chew on that though.</p>

<h3 id="jeroen-february-23-2023"><strong>Jeroen</strong>, February 23, 2023</h3>
<p>I let myself get sidetracked...</p>
<p>Not sure how much it is to procrastinate working on the actual game.
But I <em>am</em> sure that it sparked joy to play around with something else.
Here&#39;s what I changed up for this pincrediball.com&#39;s website source code.</p>
<h4 id="prose-tailwindcss-plugin">Prose TailwindCSS plugin</h4>
<p>Tailwind resets styling, so you can reliably create Web Applications and Sites.
That&#39;s all great, but for long-form textual content it&#39;s actually painful to loose <em>all</em> styling.
<a target="_blank" href='https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin'>The Tailwind &quot;Prose&quot; plugin</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a> aims to solve that, without compromising the reset of styles that Tailwind gives you.</p>
<p>It was just fine to write this devlog straight up with html and Tailwind classes.
But copy-pasting things like <code>mt-4</code> on each <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> becomes tedious pretty quickly.
The Prose plugin fixes that nicely, and cleaned up my devlog source code considerably.</p>
<h4 id="markdown-for-blogging">Markdown for blogging</h4>
<p>This also enables the next step.
Markdown is a far nicer format to write blogposts in.
I had noticed before that <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/sveltejs/sites/tree/master/sites/svelte.dev/content/blog'><code>svelte.dev</code> uses markdown for their blog</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>,
which sparked my interest.</p>
<p>After briefly trying the (rather nice!) <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/ssssota/svelte-exmarkdown'>svelte-exmarkdown</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a> library, I decided I needed a bit more control.
So I dove a bit deeper into how <code>svelte.dev</code> does things.
And that setup is quite nice indeed, as it includes support for SSR and RSS.</p>
<p>So, I used a (much) simplified variant of that setup.
And: it works like a breeze!
Adding a blog post can now be as simple as <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball.com/commit/22f4cb509b4c4fbe3b81eb4089af522c21a14bb5'>adding one <code>.md</code> file to the repository</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>!</p>
<h4 id="whats-next">What&#39;s next?</h4>
<p>That&#39;s all nice!
But what&#39;s next?
Should I ever feel like getting side-tracked again, there&#39;s a few things left to tweak:</p>
<ul>
<li>RSS feed would be nice;</li>
<li>Having <code>[slug]</code> based pages might be nice;</li>
<li>GitHub Action to <code>npm run build</code> would be nice;</li>
<li>GitHub Action to deploy GH-Pages should be nice;</li>
</ul>
<p>But for now: let&#39;s stop procrastination and get back to building the game.
Shall we?</p>

<h3 id="jeroen-february-22-2023"><strong>Jeroen</strong>, February 22, 2023</h3>
<p>Well... that was a disaster!</p>
<p>As warned by folks around me, and just as I already sortof knew would happen:
<em>rolling your own</em> (engine) is a bad idea.
Generally.
And specifically, too (at least for this case).</p>
<p>After a few hours of labor here&#39;s where I got:</p>
<video controls loop>
  <source src="/img/pincrediball-prototype-003.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Video recording of an extremely crude demo pinball machine.
</video>

<p>And then the mountain of work became visible.</p>
<p>The smart thing to do?
Enjoy a few other fun things in my sabbatical, let the project lie down for a bit.
I&#39;ll likely revitalize my enthusiasm for the project and go back to using an existing engine.
Possibly within this web app that&#39;s now set up.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for prototype <em>004</em> soon (?).
I&#39;m calling it an early day, on Day 10.</p>

<h3 id="jeroen-february-21-2023"><strong>Jeroen</strong>, February 21, 2023</h3>
<p>After <a href="#post-2023-02-20">yesterday</a> several friends helped out with some rubber duck debugging.
Got some great input on Slack and in other places about how I could wrangle the physics engine collisions into submission.
And how much I should probably let go and embrace the chaos of a realistic engine.</p>
<p>However, I still changed it up... for prototyping purposes!</p>
<p>Using PhaserJS and MatterJS might <em>still</em> be the right way to go.
But I still wanted to try out how it feels to create a fully custom engine anyways.</p>
<p>And while I was at that, I was also curious to see how far I can get with plain html, css, and JavaScript (and no <em>game</em> engine).
Using SvelteKit and Tailwind, just for prototyping speed at the moment.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t get very far yet with writing the actual game loop and time ticker.
But I did do a bunch of good work on an initial game layout.
It&#39;s far from polished, but (even though polish might be 80% of the work?!) that&#39;s for later.
Here&#39;s the initial results:</p>
<p><a href="/img/pincrediball-prototype-003-part1a.png"><img src="/img/pincrediball-prototype-003-part1a.png" alt="Game in a browser window"></a></p>
<p>Obviously, this still needs work.
But it&#39;s getting somewhere.
Even if I go the PhaserJS route after all, I might be able to use this setup in conjunction with it.</p>
<p>And I&#39;m sorry to say: that&#39;s all for today, folks!</p>
<p>As a final footnote for today&#39;s devlog: I also decided to open source the prototypes.
So you can fully see me fumbling about.
Writing all sorts of just-make-it-work code.
You can find <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/pincrediball'>all the repositories in the Pincrediball GitHub organization</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>.
And for my most loyal readers (hi mum!), here&#39;s a quick peek at it, with just a random screenshot of me hacking about in prototype number three!</p>
<p><a href="/img/pincrediball-prototype-003-part1b.png"><img src="/img/pincrediball-prototype-003-part1b.png" alt="VSCode showing prototype-003 files"></a></p>
<p>Prototype 003 will likely get some more love the coming days.
Stay tuned!</p>

<h3 id="jeroen-february-20-2023"><strong>Jeroen</strong>, February 20, 2023</h3>
<p>After not doing too much during the weekend (days 6 &amp; 7), it&#39;s now Monday of week 2 and high time to get back to the project.
After a week of &quot;meta&quot; stuff, designing, and a super-light prototype, today was spent on more in-depth prototyping.</p>
<p>I&#39;m very happy with what I <em>did</em>, but only moderately so with the <em>result</em>.
Here, have a look for yourself first:</p>
<video controls loop>
  <source src="/img/pincrediball-prototype-002.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Video recording of an extremely crude demo pinball machine.
</video>

<p><small>(Note that you see the debug boxes and vectors in these prototypes.)</small></p>
<p>Let&#39;s summarize what I learned during today&#39;s experiments, starting with the positives:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ SvelteKit will be a great &quot;bearer&quot; of the game</li>
<li>✅ Using plain html/css/js for parts of the app will likely turn out great</li>
<li>✅ Tailwind enables for fast menu&#39;s and other UI</li>
<li>✅ I got <em>something</em> looking like Pinball physics to work</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I have many concerns after today:</p>
<ul>
<li>❌ MatterJS physics is wonky ls going <em>through</em> static bounds or getting stuck)</li>
<li>❌ Level editing is cumbersome in (vanilla) Phaser, without any tools</li>
<li>❌ Curved shapes and SVG paths are a <em>major</em> pain to use</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m not so sure yet where to go from here.
Have I learned that I need to go back to my original idea?
Building a super-simple physics engine of my own, to make everything far more deterministic and reliable?
Or should I stick with out-of-the-box physics and just deal with the issues?</p>
<p>Perhaps a night&#39;s sleep and some distraction will bring clarity.</p>

<h3 id="jeroen-february-17-2023"><strong>Jeroen</strong>, February 17, 2023</h3>
<p>Today was not a very productive day, mostly because I didn&#39;t spend too much time on the project.
Still, got to a very first prototype with a plunger and a ball, plus some physics:</p>
<video controls loop>
  <source
    src="/img/pincrediball-prototype-001.webm"
    type="video/webm; codecs=vp9,vorbis"
  />
  <source src="/img/pincrediball-prototype-001.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Video recording of an extremely crude demo pinball machine.
</video>

<p>It seems the choice for PhaserJS with the MatterJS physics engine is &quot;good enough&quot; for my goals.
And I think I will just leave it to chance that I chose right, instead of heavily investigating other Game Engines.</p>
<p>That&#39;s it for day 5.
Weekend&#39;s up next, we&#39;ll see if I continue work, or whether the next update will come on Monday...</p>

<h3 id="jeroen-february-16-2023"><strong>Jeroen</strong>, February 16, 2023</h3>
<p>Today it&#39;s time to figure out an engine to use.
I&#39;m leaning heavily towards <a target="_blank" href='https://phaser.io/'>PhaserJS</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a> (the main alternatives being Godot and Unity),
because it allows me to tap into my existing web development and JavaScript skills.</p>
<p>I&#39;m mostly doing tutorials and reading documentation, so no exciting updates from today for the devlog.
That does give me a minute to share my rough &quot;plan&quot; I created earlier in the project.
Here it is:</p>
<p><a href="/img/v2023-02-14a-tipm-brainstorm.png"><img src="/img/v2023-02-14a-tipm-brainstorm.png" alt="Brainstorm overview divided in 6 sections: Design, Graphics/Art, Sound/Music, Game Loop/Engine, Polish, Publish"></a></p>
<p>It started as a brainstorm, but it became a rough &quot;plan&quot;.
Each of the six parts is roughly a timebox of one week.
I&#39;m starting with &quot;Design&quot; this week, but currently borrowing a bit from the next goal: &quot;Game Loop / Engine&quot;.</p>
<p>Stuff&#39;s color coded too: the red stuff is Must-Haves, yellow Should-Haves, and green the Nice-to-Haves.</p>
<p>What do you think?
Too optimistic?
Probably.
But let&#39;s see how far we&#39;ll get, shall we?!</p>
<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></article>
        <hr class="my-8 border-t border-t-amber-400/25"><article id="post-2023-02-15" class="scroll-mt-24 prose prose-invert max-w-none"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><h2 id="day-3-website-first">Day 3: Website first?</h2>
<h3 id="jeroen-february-15-2023"><strong>Jeroen</strong>, February 15, 2023</h3>
<p>Continuing from day 2 with a focus on <em>fun</em> activities, I decided to finish up the website.
This time I don&#39;t think I can claim anymore that it&#39;s in the end somehow part of the <em>critical path</em> though?</p>
<p>But regardless of whether it was <em>The Right Thing</em> to do right now, it <em>was</em> very effective!
I mean: you&#39;re looking at the very result right now.</p>
<p>The website was built with SvelteKit and TailwindCSS, which was rather efficient because I recently used it for both of my other recent side-projects:
<a target="_blank" href='https://tierdom.jeroenheijmans.nl'>Tierdom</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a> and <a target="_blank" href='https://vesta.infi.nl'>vesta.infi.nl</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>.
But not before I spent the entire morning learning some more Figma skills to do the entire design first.</p>
<p>I only bought the domain name, used
<a target="_blank" href='https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages#using-an-apex-domain-for-your-github-pages-site'>GitHub pages with a custom and apex domain</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>
for hosting the whole thing.
Which, after the usual DNS hassle, works quite well!</p>
<p>All this means three important things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can <em>comfortably share</em> the plans with the world</li>
<li>I am <em>on schedule</em> for week 1&#39;s plans</li>
<li>I have <em>no excuses left</em> to procrastinate prototyping</li>
</ul>
<p>So let&#39;s end this third day with some initial social media posts and links to this website.</p>
<p><strong>And tomorrow: we prototype!</strong></p>

<h3 id="jeroen-february-14-2023"><strong>Jeroen</strong>, February 14, 2023</h3>
<p>Second day I allowed myself to get side-tracked.
I decided that the best way to keep motivation high was by <em>doing essential things disguised as non-essential things</em>.
By this I mean I tried to incorporate essential things (work on the designs and game idea) into far less essential things (that were enjoyable to do).</p>
<p>First thing I did was to <strong>redo the main game screen&#39;s design</strong>.
For fun I&#39;ve shared that on the (current, at the time of writing) <a href="/">home page</a>.
After that I took care of a bunch of other non-essential (but fun!) things:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ Logo &amp; Banner designed</li>
<li>✅ YouTube channel claimed</li>
<li>✅ Itch.io account claimed</li>
<li>✅ Socials set up</li>
<li>✅ SteamWorks application submitted (and $100 fee paid...)</li>
</ul>
<p>It was a <em>fun</em> day with this too, as you can tell from <a target="_blank" href='https://mastodon.social/@jeroenheijmans/109865321998439644'>my related toot</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>.
And it really gave me a bunch of inspiration and energy to continue on!</p>

<h3 id="jeroen-february-13-2023"><strong>Jeroen</strong>, February 13, 2023</h3>
<p>First day of the week I decided to start the project.
However, the night before we watched the Super Bowl... in the GMT+1 timezone!
So was up until 04:30 (that&#39;s AM for y&#39;all), naturally this wasn&#39;t the most productive day.</p>
<p>But the most important thing got done: I got <em>started</em> on the project!
Plus several important things got done nonetheless, as <a target="_blank" href='https://mastodon.social/@jeroenheijmans/109859902264743330'>I wrote on Mastodon</span><sup class="text-xs no-underline">↗</sup></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ Brainstorm done</li>
<li>✅ Rough plan created</li>
<li>✅ Name chosen</li>
<li>✅ Domain bought!</li>
<li>✅ GitHub org and repo&#39;s claimed</li>
<li>✅ Social media names claimed</li>
<li>✅ Game loop basics designed</li>
<li>✅ Initial designs</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end would call day 1 a success!</p>

Mini-game!\r\n\r\nI named it \"prototype 006\" and might still put the code online as such.\r\nBut I mainly set out to just build a tiny game with Godot.\r\n\r\nAs a teenager I'd lie on my back in my room, endlessly tossing a small ball in the air.\r\nThe goal?\r\nTo get as close to the ceiling as possible, _without_ actually hitting it.\r\n\r\nSo I made it into a tiny Godot game.\r\nReally wanted to make it playable in the browser, more on that in a second.\r\nFirst, an example of what it looks like:\r\n\r\n[![Animated gif of a ball bouncing in the air for score](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-006.gif)](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-006.gif)\r\n\r\nYou press `[SPACE]` or `[LEFT MOUSE BUTTON]` for 0 to 2000 milliseconds to send it flying up.\r\nThe higher you get, the more points you score.\r\nIf you hit the ceiling?\r\nZero points.\r\n\r\nActually fun to build.\r\nMostly without frustration.\r\nBetter than Phaser, certainly.\r\nThis is looking promising!\r\n\r\n#### Godot exports\r\n\r\nThe actual exporting to platforms is a bit more finnicky.\r\nAndroid requires the SDK so I'm yet to try that.\r\niOS similarly likely needs special stuff.\r\n\r\nThe `.exe` Windows version was somehwat easy.\r\nIt includes the entire Godot engine though.\r\nSo my super-simple game becomes 45+ MB: not great.\r\n\r\nThe \"html5\" version is even worse.\r\nThe WASM file also clocks in at similar size.\r\nBut worse: it requires quite modern but certainly not ubiquitous Web Server headers.\r\nThe response from the Godot team was, understandably but frustratingly:\r\n[\"This is a Web Server problem that Web Servers should fix\"](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fgodotengine\u002Fgodot\u002Fissues\u002F69020#issuecomment-1324253401).\r\n\r\nIt seems that [support for needed headers](https:\u002F\u002Fstackoverflow.com\u002Fq\u002F68609682\u002F419956) won't easily work on GitHub Pages.\r\nSo no runnable version of the game on this devlog for now.\r\n\r\n#### Now what?\r\n\r\nIt'd be really sad if my final game wouldn't run well in browsers.\r\nBoth a demo version on the website, as well as an itch.io version, would be problematic.\r\nBut I don't think I'll let that hold me back.\r\nTomorrow I'll sleep in, and at some point go back to toying with Godot.\r\nMainly because it was _fun_ to do so!\r\n"},{id:"post-2023-03-01",title:"Day 17: Giving up",content:"## Day 17: Giving up\r\n\r\n### **Jeroen**, March 01, 2023\r\n\r\nI'm giving up.\r\n\r\nThe past few days have been extremely frustrating.\r\nI'm spending _days_ on trivial things like [making objects only movable by a player](https:\u002F\u002Fgamedev.stackexchange.com\u002Fquestions\u002F204691\u002Fhow-to-make-object-movable-only-by-the-player).\r\nIn those days I'm also loosing _hours_ on how utterly inconsistent and unpredictable the Phaser and Matter API are for nontrivial things.\r\n\r\nSummarizing those two things differently:\r\n\r\n1. Core Pincrediball concepts are nontrivial in Phaser's physics engine;\r\n2. Phaser itself and its engine are frustrating to work with so far;\r\n\r\nSo I'm giving up.\r\nOn my current approach.\r\n\r\n#### What now then?\r\n\r\nWell, I need to mentally reset.\r\nSo tomorrow I'll start with a completely fresh approach.\r\nNot sure which yet.\r\n\r\nTo end this day with a brainstorm of a few possible roads to take:\r\n\r\n- **Stick with Phaser and MatterJS?**\r\n  Still try to stay with Phaser, revitalize, and try to make Matter physics work for me?\r\n  Probably I should know better, given how frustrated I am right now.\r\n- **Stick with Phaser and a new Physics engine?**\r\n  Stay with Phaser, but see if there's a way to get **Box2D** to work with it?\r\n  I found [the Pinball(!) example](http:\u002F\u002Fphaser.io\u002Fexamples\u002Fv2\u002Fbox2d\u002Fpinball) but it was for the years old version 2 of Phaser.\r\n- **Try out Godot, or Unity?**\r\n  The main alternatives I'd consider (next to very maybe GameMaker).\r\n  I'm just super-worried that I first need a few weeks to learn them.\r\n- **Rolling my own engine?**\r\n  This seemed like a bad idea [after day 10](#post-2023-02-22).\r\n  But perhaps I should give it another go?\r\n- **Quit building, start (more) procrastination?**\r\n  To be honest, I've been enjoying everything _except_ building the damn game a lot.\r\n  The website, the socials, the designs, the (not-yet-existent) Kickstarter...\r\n  Perhaps I should embrace those first?\r\n- **Quit altogether?**\r\n  I have 4 out of 8 weeks left in my mini-sabbatical.\r\n  There's plenty of things to do in those weeks, other than building a game.\r\n\r\nAnd surely there are more options.\r\nI'll sleep on it, and decide when I'm fresh at it again.\r\nIt's not very likely that I'll \"Quit altogether\", but I'm keeping options open:\r\nfirst and foremost I want to be having fun.\r\nAnd, surprise: all through abovementioned frustration, I'm still having fun!\r\n\r\nBut for now, I need a break.\r\n"},{id:"post-2023-02-28",title:"Day 16: Putting it all together",content:"## Day 16: Putting it all together\r\n\r\n### **Jeroen**, February 28, 2023\r\n\r\nSecond day of week 3, and although I _am_ pushing myself through _some_ relevant work, I'm not making the progress I wanted.\r\n\r\nHeck, I'm even writing this recap at the start of day 16.\r\nSo I'm keeping it short, so I can try once more to get some work in.\r\n\r\nWhat I did yesterday is to commit on a setup.\r\nI did not name my repository for the day `prototype-...`.\r\nNo, I actually started the main game repository.\r\nAnd I merged the best bits from earlier prototype.\r\n\r\nThat means the day after this one, there are really no excuses left.\r\nWork has to be done on the game.\r\nLet's get cracking!\r\n\r\nPS.

project, day 15 of the project.\r\n\r\nI'm writing an early devlog today.\r\nAfter writing this I will probably _continue_ development.\r\nBut I feel like I reached a checkpoint _now_, so a recap is in order.\r\n\r\n#### Prototype 004\r\n\r\nLooking at the overview of posts you may wonder: \"What happened to prototype 004?\".\r\nGlad you asked!\r\nIn fact, on [Day 12](#post-2023-02-24) I combined Phaser with Svelte;\r\nonly at the end of that day did I \"promote\" it to [its own prototype repository](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Forgs\u002Fpincrediball\u002Frepositories?q=prototype).\r\nQuite likely `prototype-004` will even grow into the end result at some point.\r\n\r\n#### Ladies and Gentlemen: Prototype Number 005!\r\n\r\nSo, today I got up fresh and early.\r\nThe main problem to tackle: **some (more) determinism** in runs.\r\nOtherwise the core game loop (precisely placing parts so you get a high score) is no fun.\r\n\r\nDeterminism turns out to be quite difficult with MatterJS.\r\nBut that's only one problem.\r\nIt has no Continuous Collision Detection (CCD) either, causing the ball at high velocity to go _through_ walls.\r\nThis might get worse once I get to implementing flippers, I suspect.\r\nSo I was doubting my engine choice a bit.\r\n\r\nStill, after a productive morning, I found that things might be good enough for now.\r\nI tweaked the engine settings to a point where many parallel instances of my game would all give the same result.\r\nHere's [the \"proof\" of that](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fprototype-005):\r\n\r\n\u003Cvideo controls loop\u003E\r\n  \u003Csource

prototype made two things clear to me:\r\n\r\n- It gives enough _confidence_ to move forward with my current setup;\r\n- It causes enough _doubt_ that this engine should be the final choice for a _full_ game;\r\n\r\nIn short: a nice check point reached!\r\n\r\n#### What's next?\r\n\r\nSo the next steps are to go \"all in\" on the current approach.\r\nMore specifically, my to do list is currently:\r\n\r\n- Design a good looking tutorial theme and pinball machine;\r\n- Integrate that design, Prototype 004, and Prototype nr. 5;\r\n- Allow the player to move bumpers around\r\n- Add flippers to the game;\r\n\r\nPerhaps a few sound effects to make working on this project a bit more fun too.\r\nI will roll up the rest of today's work in the next devlog entry either way.\r\nStay tuned!\r\n"},{id:"post-2023-02-24",title:"Day 12: Combining Phaser and Svelte",content:"## Day 12: Combining Phaser and Svelte\r\n\r\n### **Jeroen**, February 24, 2023\r\n\r\nI'm back to integrating PhaserJS with the MatterJS physics engine, and Svelte.\r\nThe fourth prototype uses some of the domain entities from prototype-003.\r\nAnd it includes a Phaser scene for the actual Pinball machine.\r\n\r\nFor lack of time (the weekend calls for other obligations) I'll just use a static screenshot for the blog:\r\n\r\n[![Game in a browser window](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-004-part1.png)](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-004-part1.png)\r\n\r\nThe rest of today was spent on trying to make Matter more deterministic.\r\nAnd in that process I got (again) a bit side tracked with [an energy conservation issue](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fliabru\u002Fmatter-js\u002Fissues\u002F256#issuecomment-1443680697) with MatterJS.\r\n\r\nSo we close off this week with far less results than I'd hoped.\r\nFor a large part because I procrastinated and let myself get side tracked though.\r\nWhat all that does mean is that I need to re-evaluate my goals and approach next week.\r\n\r\nWhat's super important is that the machine becomes more deterministic.\r\nThe whole \"automata player\" and game loop idea falls apart if different runs of the automata have different outcomes.\r\nEither the setup needs to become (more) deterministic, or the game loop has to change.\r\nOr my goals for the project need to change...\r\n\r\nGot a weekend to chew on that though.\r\n"},{id:"post-2023-02-23",title:"Day 11: Sidetracked with Markdown",content:"## Day 11: Sidetracked with Markdown\r\n\r\n### **Jeroen**, February 23, 2023\r\n\r\nI let myself get sidetracked...\r\n\r\nNot sure how much it is to procrastinate working on the actual game.\r\nBut I _am_ sure that it sparked joy to play around with something else.\r\nHere's what I changed up for this pincrediball.com's website source code.\r\n\r\n#### Prose TailwindCSS plugin\r\n\r\nTailwind resets styling, so you can reliably create Web Applications and Sites.\r\nThat's all great, but for long-form textual content it's actually painful to loose _all_ styling.\r\n[The Tailwind \"Prose\" plugin](https:\u002F\u002Ftailwindcss.com\u002Fdocs\u002Ftypography-plugin) aims to solve that, without compromising the reset of styles that Tailwind gives you.\r\n\r\nIt was just fine to write this devlog straight up with html and Tailwind classes.\r\nBut copy-pasting things like `mt-4` on each `\u003Cp\u003E` becomes tedious pretty quickly.\r\nThe Prose plugin fixes that nicely, and cleaned up my devlog source code considerably.\r\n\r\n#### Markdown for blogging\r\n\r\nThis also enables the next step.\r\nMarkdown is a far nicer format to write blogposts in.\r\nI had noticed before that [`svelte.dev` uses markdown for their blog](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fsveltejs\u002Fsites\u002Ftree\u002Fmaster\u002Fsites\u002Fsvelte.dev\u002Fcontent\u002Fblog),\r\nwhich sparked my interest.\r\n\r\nAfter briefly trying the (rather nice!) [svelte-exmarkdown](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fssssota\u002Fsvelte-exmarkdown) library, I decided I needed a bit more control.\r\nSo I dove a bit deeper into how `svelte.dev` does things.\r\nAnd that setup is quite nice indeed, as it includes support for SSR and RSS.\r\n\r\nSo, I used a (much) simplified variant of that setup.\r\nAnd: it works like a breeze!\r\nAdding a blog post can now be as simple as [adding one `.md` file to the repository](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fpincrediball.com\u002Fcommit\u002F22f4cb509b4c4fbe3b81eb4089af522c21a14bb5)!\r\n\r\n#### What's next?\r\n\r\nThat's all nice!\r\nBut what's next?\r\nShould I ever feel like getting side-tracked again, there's a few things left to tweak:\r\n\r\n- RSS feed would be nice;\r\n- Having `[slug]` based pages might be nice;\r\n- GitHub Action to `npm run build` would be nice;\r\n- GitHub Action to deploy GH-Pages should be nice;\r\n\r\nBut for now: let's stop procrastination and get back to building the game.\r\nShall we?\r\n"},{id:"post-2023-02-22",title:"Day 10: Prototype 003, part 2",content:"## Day 10: Prototype 003, part 2\r\n\r\n### **Jeroen**, February 22, 2023\r\n\r\nWell... that was a disaster!\r\n\r\nAs

my sabbatical, let the project lie down for a bit.\r\nI'll likely revitalize my enthusiasm for the project and go back to using an existing engine.\r\nPossibly within this web app that's now set up.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for prototype _004_ soon (?).\r\nI'm calling it an early day, on Day 10.\r\n"},{id:"post-2023-02-21",title:"Day 9: Prototype 003, part 1",content:"## Day 9: Prototype 003, part

about how I could wrangle the physics engine collisions into submission.\r\nAnd how much I should probably let go and embrace the chaos of a realistic engine.\r\n\r\nHowever, I still changed it up... for prototyping purposes!\r\n\r\nUsing PhaserJS and MatterJS might _still_ be the right way to go.\r\nBut I still wanted to try out how it feels to create a fully custom engine anyways.\r\n\r\nAnd while I was at that, I was also curious to see how far I can get with plain html, css, and JavaScript (and no _game_ engine).\r\nUsing SvelteKit and Tailwind, just for prototyping speed at the moment.\r\n\r\nI didn't get very far yet with writing the actual game loop and time ticker.\r\nBut I did do a bunch of good work on an initial game layout.\r\nIt's far from polished, but (even though polish might be 80% of the work?!) that's for later.\r\nHere's the initial results:\r\n\r\n[![Game in a browser window](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-003-part1a.png)](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-003-part1a.png)\r\n\r\nObviously, this still needs work.\r\nBut it's getting somewhere.\r\nEven if I go the PhaserJS route after all, I might be able to use this setup in conjunction with it.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm sorry to say: that's all for today, folks!\r\n\r\nAs a final footnote for today's devlog: I also decided to open source the prototypes.\r\nSo you can fully see me fumbling about.\r\nWriting all sorts of just-make-it-work code.\r\nYou can find [all the repositories in the Pincrediball GitHub

learned during today's experiments, starting with the positives:\r\n\r\n- ✅ SvelteKit will be a great \"bearer\" of the game\r\n- ✅ Using plain html\u002Fcss\u002Fjs for parts of the app will likely turn out great\r\n- ✅ Tailwind enables for fast menu's and other UI\r\n- ✅ I got _something_ looking like Pinball physics to work\r\n\r\nHowever, I have many concerns after today:\r\n\r\n- ❌ MatterJS physics is wonky ls going _through_ static bounds or getting stuck)\r\n- ❌ Level editing is cumbersome in (vanilla) Phaser, without any tools\r\n- ❌ Curved shapes and SVG paths are a _major_ pain to use\r\n\r\nI'm not so sure yet where to go from here.\r\nHave I learned that I need to go back to my original idea?\r\nBuilding a super-simple physics engine of my own, to make everything far more deterministic and reliable?\r\nOr should I stick with out-of-the-box physics and just deal with the issues?\r\n\r\nPerhaps a night's sleep and some distraction will bring clarity.\r\n"},{id:"post-2023-02-17",title:"Day 5: Prototype 001",content:"## Day 5: Prototype 001\r\n\r\n### **Jeroen**, February 17, 2023\r\n\r\nToday was not a very productive day, mostly because I

hosting the whole thing.\r\nWhich, after the usual DNS hassle, works quite well!\r\n\r\nAll this means three important things:\r\n\r\n- I can _comfortably share_ the plans with the world\r\n- I am _on schedule_ for week 1's plans\r\n- I have _no excuses left_ to procrastinate prototyping\r\n\r\nSo let's end this third day with some initial social media posts and links to this website.\r\n\r\n**And tomorrow: we prototype!**\r\n"},{id:"post-2023-02-14",title:"Day 2: Now we're getting somewhere!",content:"## Day 2: Now we're getting somewhere!\r\n\r\n### **Jeroen**, February 14, 2023\r\n\r\nSecond day I allowed myself to get side-tracked.\r\nI decided that the best way to keep motivation high was by _doing essential things disguised as non-essential things_.\r\nBy this I mean I tried to incorporate essential things (work on the designs and game idea) into far less essential things (that were enjoyable to do).\r\n\r\nFirst thing I did was to **redo the main game screen's design**.\r\nFor fun I've shared that on the (current, at the time of writing) [home page](\u002F).\r\nAfter that I took care of a bunch of other non-essential (but fun!) things:\r\n\r\n- ✅ Logo &amp; Banner designed\r\n- ✅ YouTube channel claimed\r\n- ✅ Itch.io account claimed\r\n- ✅ Socials set up\r\n- ✅ SteamWorks application submitted (and $100 fee paid...)\r\n\r\nIt was a _fun_ day with this too, as you can tell from [my related toot](https:\u002F\u002Fmastodon.social\u002F@jeroenheijmans\u002F109865321998439644).\r\nAnd it really gave me a bunch of inspiration and energy to continue on!\r\n"},{id:"post-2023-02-13",title:"Day 1: Gotta start somewhere!",content:"## Day 1: Gotta start somewhere!\r\n\r\n### **Jeroen**, February 13, 2023\r\n\r\nFirst day of the week I decided to start the project.\r\nHowever, the night before we watched the Super Bowl... in the GMT+1 timezone!\r\nSo was up until 04:30 (that's AM for y'all), naturally this wasn't the most productive day.\r\n\r\nBut the most important thing got done: I got _started_ on the project!\r\nPlus several important things got done nonetheless, as [I wrote on Mastodon](https:\u002F\u002Fmastodon.social\u002F@jeroenheijmans\u002F109859902264743330):\r\n\r\n- ✅ Brainstorm done\r\n- ✅ Rough plan created\r\n- ✅ Name chosen\r\n- ✅ Domain bought!\r\n- ✅ GitHub org and repo's claimed\r\n- ✅ Social media names claimed\r\n- ✅ Game loop basics designed\r\n- ✅ Initial designs\r\n\r\nIn the end would call day 1 a success!\r\n"}]},"uses":{}}];
