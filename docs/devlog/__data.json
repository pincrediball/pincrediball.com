You'll be amazed at how fast you'll be able to build stuff. And the \"elbow grease\" needed to get a game completed will feel totally normal. You won't miss any of the stuff that I felt was lacking. | üò≠ **This was _my_ corner**. Nearly none of the tools and techniques you know and love from creating back-ends or front-ends will be available. You'll be struggling to find information on proper CI\u002FCD, automated testing, inversion of control, or tooling and architecture in general. |\r\n| **Lots of GAME Dev Experience** | üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **You're likely a wizard!** You've honed your skill and learned tricks from the industry. Or you may work for a big(ger) studio with in-house tooling to compensate for the lack of industry-wide knowledge.

Bridge the gap between the wonderful things from Web Development and their equivalents in Game Development.                                    |\r\n\r\nIn terms of [the psychological \"Four stages of competence\"](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FFour_stages_of_competence)\r\n(related to the Dunning-Kruger effect) I feel like I am **\"Consciously Incompetent\"** as far as Game Development is concerned.\r\nBecause I'm still incompetent, I might very well be wrong.\r\nBut I'd claim:\r\n\r\n\u003E Game Development seriously lacks broadly available proper practices and tooling.\r\n\r\nHere are come examples of what I found lacking.\r\nContinuous Integration and Deployment knowledge and tooling is nearly non-existent.\r\nAutomated testing is hardly talked about.\r\nThere's very little high quality knowledge or documentation about how Data flows through apps.\r\nAnd in general it's very hard to find best practices around architecture and all things related.\r\n\r\nPut differently, consider .NET Core, Laravel, SvelteKit, NextJS, or a dozen other web development frameworks.\r\nEach of those has amazing and extensive documentation and great starter templates, to create robust and future proof code.\r\nComparing that to the PhaserJS and Godot situation, I found things seriously lacking.\r\nI hear similar stories from friends and colleagues working with Unity or Unreal Engine.\r\n\r\nBut!\r\n**Do not let this deter you from developing a game**, which is fun even when game development is... disappointing at times.\r\n\r\nAnd if you're keen on doing so, you may find some value in my experience.\r\nSo let me close off with a few more positive notes about my experience.\r\n\r\n### Favorite devlogs\r\n\r\nSince I already wrote what I wanted to share, I can just link to previous work.\r\nStarting with my own suggested **Top 5 Pincrediball Devlog Posts** for those interested.\r\nThey are:\r\n\r\n1. [Day 45: Statistics](#post-2023-03-29): effort needed to do a project like this.\r\n2. [Day 44: Giving back](#post-2023-03-28): some love for the tools I used.\r\n3. [Day 24: Tutorial Machine](#post-2023-03-08): promising results halfway through are great!\r\n4. [Day 17: Giving up](#post-2023-03-01): the inevitable solo game development \"crash\".\r\n5. [Day 01: Gotta start somewhere](#post-2023-02-13): just look at how little is needed to get started!\r\n\r\nBut of course if you feel like it you can also scan or read through the entire devlog since day 1.\r\n\r\n### Source code\r\n\r\nIf you're a Web Developer going into Game Development with Godot, you might also find [the Pincrediball Source](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fpincrediball) a useful resource.\r\nDisclaimer: I am by no means a Godot expert.\r\nHowever, I did try to create as clean and robust code as I could with the tools available.\r\n\r\nIf you're going to look through the code, I particularly would recommend looking at:\r\n\r\n- My poor-man's implementation of **Unidirectional Data Flow** (e.g. in [the Scoring \"store\"](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fblob\u002Fmain\u002Fsrc\u002Fgame\u002Fcore\u002Fscoring.gd).\r\n  It has to rely on the singleton pattern, public functions for actions, and events instead of selectors.\r\n  But it gets the job done: things are highly cohesive but not tightly coupled.\r\n  It prevents a ton of data being passed around and events bubbling through the inheritance tree.\r\n- Being forced by Godot to rely on inheritance over composition,\r\n  I still manage to apply some **Inversion of Control** (e.g. in [the Base Pinball Component](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fblob\u002Fmain\u002Fsrc\u002Fgame\u002Ftutorial\u002Fcomponent_base.gd)).\r\n- The code style, which follows [the official Style Guide](https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.godotengine.org\u002Fen\u002Fstable\u002Ftutorials\u002Fscripting\u002Fgdscript\u002Fgdscript_styleguide.html) closely\r\n  and would pass **Linting Tools**... if there would've been any.\r\n- The general [**Folder Structure**](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fpincrediball\u002Ftree\u002Fmain\u002Fsrc) for which there is no real guidance in the Godot ecosystem.\r\n  I spent quite a bit of time finding something half-decent.\r\n  It will _not_ hold up for very large games.\r\n  But should work for small and medium sized ones.\r\n\r\nBut I also recommend you only take this as inspiration, and a way to \"not feel alone\" as a web developer in the Godot world.\r\nDo not take it as a set of best practices or recommendations... remember:\r\n**I am consciously incompetent**.\r\n\r\n### Final words\r\n\r\nI'm happy I took a stab at game development.\r\nI'm proud that I finished an entire game, and got it published on Steam.\r\nIt was fun, and I'll likely do something similar again!\r\n\r\nBut my final words on this devlog can only be a repeat of this post's title...\r\n\r\n**Game development sucks. But developing games rocks!**\r\n",{"id":13,"isDraft":14,"order":15,"date":16,"title":17,"content":18},"post-2023-07-15",false,1,["Date","2023-07-15T00:00:00.000Z"],"Day 105: Releasing on Steam","## Day 105: Releasing on Steam\r\n\r\n**_Jeroen_, July 15, 2023**\r\n\r\nMy last post was \"Day 47\" (March 31st).\r\nSince then 58 days have past.\r\nMy sabbatical was over and I've been back to work and other hobbies.\r\nHowever, I did still spend a ton of time on Pincrediball over those weeks.\r\n\r\n### Hours needed to get onto Steam\r\n\r\nNearly all of that work went towards getting the game onto Steam.\r\nI was hoping it was only a little more work than publishing on Itch.io.\r\nBoy, was I _wrong_!!\r\n\r\nIn sunk [an estimated 361 hours of work](#post-2023-03-29) into the full game and release on Itch.io.\r\nIn addition to that **I estimate publishing on Steam cost about another 100 hours or so**.\r\nThat includes roughly 12 hours of work on creating and coding the Steam Achievements.\r\n\r\nThat's _insane_!\r\n\r\nThere's two factors to all this.\r\nFirst, the back office for partners at Steam is... outdated, and not the most user friendly web app in the world.\r\nYes, that's an understatement.\r\nSecond, there is just a _ton_ of forms to complete.\r\nLet's dive into that, shall we?!\r\n\r\n### Stuff needed to release on Steam\r\n\r\nOfficially the Steam Partner features are under \"Confidential\".\r\nI'm not actually allowed to share the actual pages of the partner dashboards.\r\nBut I surely I can get away with giving a broad overview of what's needed to release a game on Steam.\r\nOr at least what was needed for Pincrediball.\r\nSo, without further ado...\r\n\r\n**Here's a grand overview of all the things _I_ needed to do to release on Steam**:\r\n\r\n#### Store and Library settings\r\n\r\n- Basic Info\r\n  - Name, Developer, Publisher, etc.\r\n  - External links (about 8 options)\r\n  - Social Media Links (4 hardcoded options)\r\n  - Search Keywords, comma-separated\r\n  - Supported Platforms (3 OS'es, both Minimum and Recommended System Requirements)\r\n  - Release Date\r\n  - Supported Languages (Interface, Audio, Subtitles)\r\n  - Number of players supported (a dozen or so checkboxes)\r\n  - Supported Features (Achievements, Stats, Steam Cloud, etc.; about 16 checkboxes)\r\n  - Genres (Primary and Secondary)\r\n  - Tags (at least 5, but up to 20)\r\n  - Controller support (radio button options)\r\n  - DRM Info (if any), 3rd Party Accounts info\r\n  - Legal lines (rich text)\r\n  - Support Contact Info\r\n- Description\r\n  - About This Game (rich text, a few paragraphs at least)\r\n  - Short Description (one paragraph)\r\n  - Reviews and Awards from external parties\r\n- Early Access\r\n  - \"Why\" section, rich text, at least one paragraph\r\n  - \"How long\" section, rich text, at least one paragraph\r\n  - \"Full Version\" section, rich text, at least one paragraph\r\n  - \"Current State\" section, rich text, at least one paragraph\r\n  - \"Pricing Info\" section, rich text, at least one paragraph\r\n  - \"Community feedback\" section, rich text, at least one paragraph\r\n- Assets\r\n  - Store assets (5 exactly sized images, plus at least 5 screenshots)\r\n  - Library assets (4 exactly sized images)\r\n  - Broadcast assets (1 exactly sized image)\r\n- Trailer\r\n  - Full HD H.264 video upload\r\n  - Thumbnail image\r\n\r\n#### Steamworks settings\r\n\r\n- Application\r\n  - Name (yes, again)\r\n  - Supported Operating Systems (yes, again)\r\n  - Release date (yes, again)\r\n- Steam Pipe\r\n  - Depots (basically ZIP's with your game files, one per OS in my case)\r\n  - Branch and Builds with Depots to be included\r\n  - Packages that are linked to Depots\r\n- Installation\r\n  - Windows launch options\r\n  - macOS launch options\r\n  - Linux and Steam Deck launch options\r\n  - Client Images (icon)\r\n- Stats & Achievements\r\n  - Stats (11 total for Pincrediball)\r\n  - Achievements (9 total for Pincrediball) with two images for each one\r\n- Community\r\n  - Official Community Group with custom icon image\r\n- Beta keys\r\n  - Custom request for beta keys\r\n\r\n#### Additional stuff\r\n\r\nBefore even gettings started you need to:\r\n\r\n- Fill out all Personal and Company details\r\n- Complete an 8 step Tax form with personal identification\r\n\r\nAnd finally, note a few special things:\r\n\r\n- Reserve time to handle all feedback from the review process of your store listing\r\n- You need to pay a \"Steam Direct Fee\" of $100 to create a new game at all on Steam (refunded if you exceed a certain amount of sales)\r\n- Publishing a game is another 2-5 business days review process\r\n- Reserve time to build scripts to publish the Depots using the Steam SDK\r\n\r\nWew, that's a _lot_ of stuff, isn't it?\r\nAnd there's something else as well...\r\n\r\n### GodotSteam\r\n\r\nThat's right!\r\nYou actually need to write _code_ in your game to support Steam.\r\nThere's three things I wanted to do when I started integration:\r\n\r\n- Basic steam integration (screenshots, shift-tab, etc.)\r\n- Statistics per player (for potential Leaderboards)\r\n- Achievements!\r\n\r\nIntegrating the Steam SDK in your game would be a rather complicated programming task.\r\nFortunately there's [GodotSteam](https:\u002F\u002Fgodotsteam.com\u002F):\r\nan open source project to make it easy to integrate Steam into your Godot game.\r\nAnd it was a breeze to use!\r\nI extended my \"[Giving back](#post-2023-03-28)\" and donated $9,- (small bits help too, right?) to the project's core maintainer.\r\n\r\nYou can check out [the only _43_ lines of code](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fblob\u002Fmain\u002Fsrc\u002Fsteam\u002Fsteam_facade.gd) needed to integrate Steam into Pincrediball.\r\n\r\n### Available now!\r\n\r\nI was extremely motivated to get my game onto Steam.\r\nGood thing too, because it was no joke to get through all that's needed.\r\n\r\nAs a consumer, I find Steam to be a great platform.\r\nThe quality of games is of course a lot higher than on Itch.io.\r\nIn part, that's probably due to the heavy weight process behind it.\r\nIt's baffling how bad the UX of their backoffice is at times, but I appreciate how hard it is to maintain a service like Steam.\r\n\r\nRegardless.... _I made it_!\r\nThe game has been out on Steam for a few days now.\r\nIt's in \"Early Access\" and free of charge.\r\nGo [check Pincrediball out on store.steampowered.com](https:\u002F\u002Fstore.steampowered.com\u002Fapp\u002F2378150\u002FPincrediball\u002F).\r\n\r\nAll that's left to do now is to write a good wrap-up of the entire project.\r\nMaybe publish my work in a few other places.\r\nAnd after that, I think I will \"close\" off this Pincrediball chapter.\r\n\r\nWhat a ride it's been.\r\n",{"key":20,"posts":21},"2023, week 13",[22,28,34,40,46],{"id":23,"isDraft":14,"order":24,"date":25,"title":26,"content":27},"post-2023-03-31",2,["Date","2023-03-31T00:00:00.000Z"],"Day 47: Home stretch!

I won't blame you for sitting this one out.\r\n\r\n### Game Development Specifics\r\n\r\nFirst, let's start with things largely _specific_ to game development.\r\n\r\n#### Shaders\r\n\r\nWhen playing AAA games a loading screen might call out \"_Pre-processing shaders_\" or something similar.\r\nSo I knew there was something called \"shaders\".\r\nBut since this week I know what they actually are.\r\nAnd how to make (a basic) one.\r\n\r\nIn my understanding, a shader is (usually) a short program written in a specific shader-language.\r\nIt's used to manipulate pixels and other low-level graphics objects just before they reach the screen.\r\nYou can layer and combine them with other shaders, on top of an the original textures and rendered pixels.\r\n\r\nYes, that's a gross and possibly imperfect oversimplification!\r\nBut I think I'll defer to [the Wikipedia article](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FShader) and its references for a better overview.\r\n\r\nI [adapted a basic an existing shader](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fblob\u002Fmain\u002Fsrc\u002Fmenu\u002Fmenu.gdshader) to have a starry background for the game.\r\nAnd I'm confident I could do some more stuff with shaders myself now, if I want or need to.\r\n\r\n#### Particles\r\n\r\nThis does what it says on the tin: it generates particles!\r\nThink \"fireworks\" and \"confetti\".\r\n\r\nA good friend tipped me to try and add some more things for the \"feel\" of the game.\r\nWhich is a great tip, and a good incentive to learn about particles.\r\nSo now there's now a little celebratory fireworks for achieving a medal score:\r\n\r\n\u003Cvideo controls loop\u003E\r\n  \u003Csource src=\"\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-v1-20230326-particles.mp4\" type=\"video\u002Fmp4\" \u002F\u003E\r\n  fireworks in the game\r\n\u003C\u002Fvideo\u003E\r\n\r\nIn the background you can also see the \"Stars\" shader in action.\r\n\r\n#### Animations\r\n\r\nGodot does animations with an `AnimationPlayer` (and a `Tree` for complex stuff) node.\r\nMy experience with Non-Linear Editing tools for video came in handy here.\r\nBasically you create a little timeline, add a \"track\" per thing to animate.\r\nThen tell it the \"Key Frame\" states, and Godot animates between those states.\r\n\r\nI only used it for simple fade in- and out animations so far, for example for the splash screen.\r\nBut it can do far more complex stuff, prime example being animation of physics objects (e.g. a \"walking\" animation).\r\nWhich (I fear) can easily slurp up a lot of time.\r\n\r\nBy the way, many things you see \"animate\" (move) in the game currently are _not_ animations.\r\nThey fall under a different category, up next.\r\n\r\n#### Audio\r\n\r\nThe tip to add audio sooner rather than later was gold.\r\nBecause with some generated and royalty-free sounds you can go a long way.\r\nAnd Godot makes it rather easy to just have code play a sound or two at the right time.\r\n\r\nApart from the very basics, I have not touched any of the advanced stuff.\r\nI know there's things like spatial audio, sound effects, and many more.\r\nBut I left those out of scope for this project.\r\nSo not much more to say here.\r\n\r\n#### Physics\r\n\r\nIn a game engine like Godot, two things go hand in hand: graphics and physics.\r\nAny game object with physics or collision properties takes part in a simulated 2D or 3D world.\r\nA tiny \"delta\" of a few milliseconds is taken each \"step\" to estimate the next state of the world.\r\nAfter that the graphics are updated to reflect that.\r\n\r\nThere's a _million_ things to properly arrange and set to create interesting games.\r\nIncluding:\r\n\r\n- **Physics properties**, such as gravity, friction, mass, inertia, torque, and many more.\r\n- **Collision details**, like the collision shapes of things as well as layers (which things can collide with each other)\r\n\r\nIt's incredibly easy to get started.\r\nAnd it's incredibly tough to debug and tweak.\r\n\r\n### Web Development Overlap\r\n\r\nSecond, there are a few things that have overlap with building web apps.\r\nThings you also need to master (at least a bit) and work out in a game.\r\nA quick list.\r\n\r\n#### Language\r\n\r\nFor Godot you _can_ choose C#, a language I know well.\r\nBut nearly _all_ examples and knowledge online uses GDScript, so I stuck with that.\r\nGDScript is Godot's Python-like scripting language.\r\nEasy enough to pick up if you know a little Python or other languages.\r\nBut certainly rough around the edges, and annoying to use at times.\r\n\r\n#### Data\r\n\r\nThis feels like a really underdeveloped area of (Godot) game development.\r\nI _know_ big game studios _must_ be using the techniques we know from other fields.\r\nBut beginners will find tutorials suggesting spreadsheets, exports to CSV, and some duck typing after reading the data.\r\n**Insanity!**\r\nAnd it doesn't help that the main language (GDScript) doesn't know if it wants to be truly Object-Oriented, or not.\r\n\r\n#### Data-Flow\r\n\r\nWith data-flow, it feels like only 1% of generic software development practices reach game development.\r\nMany important patterns -with the exception of State Machines!- are nearly absent in tutorials and documentation.\r\n\r\nAgain, surely big studios and experts have solutions, right?\r\nBut beginners are left creating spaghetti and tightly coupled singletons.\r\nAnd I found myself somewhere in between, implementing poor-man's versions of uni-directional data flows and message buses.\r\n\r\n#### GUI Layout\r\n\r\nPowerful and workable on one hand.\r\nOn the other hand, it reminds me of FrontPage, DreamWeaver, Java Swing, WinForms, as well as the tables-for-layout era of web development.\r\nA _pain_ to use.\r\nWorth a devlog (essentially a long rant) on its own.\r\nBut having _something_ like this at all was great; not sure how far I'd gotten without it.\r\nSo mixed feelings about this in the end.\r\n\r\n#### Tooling\r\n\r\nThe main tool is the Godot editor.\r\n\r\nThe visual designer was extremely helpful as a beginner.\r\nFrustrating at times (looking at you, Undo Feature!), but a smooth experience for the most part.\r\n\r\nThe script editor, (nonexistent) refactoring tools, file system-based project structure, and overall editing experience...\r\nWell, let's say we're _spoiled_ as web developers.\r\nThe experience with Godot is \"okay\", but not nearly as good as when doing web development.\r\n\r\nYou _can_ use external editors and tooling (like VSCode or Visual Studio), but that felt firmly outside of a beginner's scope.\r\n\r\n#### Debugging\r\n\r\nUgh.\r\n\r\nOkay, I guess I'm grateful we have _something_.\r\nBreak points mostly work.\r\nInspectors largely work, and there's always `print` statements, right?\r\nPlus, shout out to the option to show collision shapes in a game: super helpful!\r\n\r\nBut it's absolutely no match for the debug tools we get in modern browsers.\r\nOr the experience in -say- Visual Studio or JetBrains tooling.\r\nMany times with Godot I found myself just going through and changing _all_ properties of an object, until I hit the right one.\r\n\r\nBut quite possibly this one's on me, for not learning the tools properly before using them?\r\n\r\n#### Version Control\r\n\r\nBasically the same as in web development.\r\nIt's great that most assets are text based files.\r\nSo git does the trick.\r\n\r\nFor larger games you probably need a better solution for binary assets such as art and sound?\r\nBut for small projects I think throwing them (neatly) in your repository works well enough.\r\n\r\n### In summary\r\n\r\nGame Development made me investigate _new_ tools and techniques.\r\nThings I didn't know much about at all from web development.\r\nI touched the basics of **Shaders, Particles, Animations, Audio, and Physics**.\r\nAnd there are many more things to learn about as well.\r\n**A great experience to try my hand at these things!**\r\n\r\nGame Development also showed _overlap_ with Web Development.\r\nI often felt underwhelmed and disappointed here.\r\nIt still eludes me how to do proper **architecture, data (flow), layout work, tooling, and debugging** in Game Development.\r\nBut really, **I expect this largely to be due to my own lack of research and learning**.\r\n\r\nI suppose this post has become a (technical) summary of the entire project.\r\nWhich is great, because that leaves one less thing to procrastinate with next week.\r\nWhen I should really _finish_ the project.\r\n",{"id":62,"isDraft":14,"order":63,"date":64,"title":65,"content":66},"post-2023-03-24",8,["Date","2023-03-24T00:00:00.000Z"],"Day 40: Dropping what we don't need!","## Day 40: Dropping

handled.\r\nBut in my defense I'll say that this is okay for a hobby project...\r\nand it seems to be \"The Way\" for game development in general?\r\n\r\nAnyways, let's end this week with a recap of where things stand.\r\n\r\n### Current State\r\n\r\nAnd as you by now know, I prefer to show that with a quick video:\r\n\r\n\u003Cvideo controls loop muted\u003E\r\n  \u003Csource

(who also happens to be a very good game developer) to play the current version.\r\nQuality of the game(play) aside for a moment, I think the game felt quite playable already.\r\nLooking at him poke about, tweaking the machine, just to see what will happen next, was rewarding for sure!\r\n\r\nThe \"Current State\" also includes that I'm at the eve of the final week of this project.\r\nSo that brings us to what's up next.\r\n\r\n### Final stretch\r\n\r\nWith the merged PR today I closed the [alpha-release milestone](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fmilestone\u002F1?closed=1).\r\nNext up is the [beta-release milestone](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fmilestone\u002F2).\r\nThat includes (at the time of writing this) the following work:\r\n\r\n- Medals and level progression\r\n- Gates and Drop Target Banks\r\n- Forces (gravity, friction, etc) tweaks\r\n- Some content for YouTube and other socials\r\n- Reserve itch.io and Steam Store page\r\n- Some polish\r\n\r\nAnd heck, I'll be dropping anything which I don't absolutely _need_.\r\n\r\nEither way, there's one week left in my mini-sabbatical.\r\nAnd... **this seems doable!**\r\nMind you: \"doable\" in the sense that \"it _can_ be done\", not \"this will be easy\".\r\nI'm optimistic, not ignorant.\r\n\r\nAlso, **what I (currently) still lack in game development skills, I think I make up for with persistence and commitment**.\r\nPut differently: building a _high quality_ game will be for some other time,\r\n_finishing_ something is the name of the current game!\r\n\r\nLet's see if I can make good on those claims next week?\r\n",{"id":68,"isDraft":14,"order":69,"date":70,"title":71,"content":72},"post-2023-03-23",9,["Date","2023-03-23T00:00:00.000Z"],"Day 39: Dragging

Improvements\r\n\r\nThe menu screens and all that are just so satisfying.\r\nRounding the project out as an actual game.\r\nIf even of dubious quality.\r\n\r\nFirst up, we have some proper options.\r\nStyling `CheckButton`s in Godot is again an absolute _pain_, and not fun work at all.\r\nBut I'd learned my lesson and switched to `TextureButtons` within minutes:\r\n\r\n[![Sound and

work!\r\nAnd I'm sure you will believe me when I say that a working \"_Continue Game_\" option is equally glorious!?\r\n\r\n### Gameplay Improvements\r\n\r\nSeveral things have been improved on the gameplay side as well:\r\n\r\n- ‚úî Scores now show the medals you achieve as you run a playbook\r\n- ‚úî Score targets are now data-driven, can be different per level\r\n- ‚úî Disabled scoring when running a \"Stress Test\" is now more clear\r\n- ‚úî Component unlocks has been prepared\r\n- ‚úî A \"DEBUG\" button allows you to skip to the last level and unlock all components\r\n\r\nJust for something shiny to look at, here's all of that in action:\r\n\r\n[![Gameplay

talk about a beta release.\r\nBecause if quality levels are negotiable, we can get to the fixed deadline and feature set sooner.\r\nAnd looking at the [Project Board](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Forgs\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fprojects\u002F1\u002Fviews\u002F1) we're pretty close, actually.\r\n\r\nAnd that's a good thing, because I have one day plus one week left.\r\nSo let's reach a good milestone tomorrow, shall

Procrastination\r\n\r\n**_Jeroen_, March 22, 2023**\r\n\r\nI needed a _\"win\"_ today.\r\nSo I took a break from Drag & Drop, hoping for a break in Godot gotchas as well.\r\nTime for some \"**Productive Procrastination**\"!\r\n\r\n### Splash screen\r\n\r\nI finalized the splash screen.\r\nNot much to say or show about this.\r\nBut it does round out the game as a real _game_.\r\n\r\n### Menu\r\n\r\nAlthough not even strictly necessary, I wanted to further \"round out\" Pincrediball with a proper menu.\r\nSo I built one today.\r\nLet's enjoy the results before we \"enjoy\" the struggles:\r\n\r\n[![Animation of the menu with classic game controls like \"New Game\" and \"Exit\"](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-v1-20230322-menu.gif.gif)](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-v1-20230322-menu.gif.gif)\r\n\r\nBuilding this felt like I was teleported back to 1998.\r\nThat's when I was doing web layouts with tables.\r\nWe were building rounded corners on things with 3x3 tables and a background image tailored to each cell.\r\n\r\n_Anno 2023_ Godot even has [a dedicated control](https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.godotengine.org\u002Fen\u002Fstable\u002Fclasses\u002Fclass_ninepatchrect.html) for this.\r\nNow that remark's a bit of a cheap shot, but even the _intended_ controls are an absolute _pain_.\r\nFor sure a pain to _learn_, and so far also a pain to _use_.\r\n\r\nSo I gave up.\r\nAnd just created some pixel-perfect buttons in Figma, once for each state.\r\nAnd used a `TextureButton`.\r\nCop out?\r\nMaybe.\r\nSatisfying?\r\nHell yes!\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\nThe pinnacle of productive procrastination must be to create Credits for an unfinished game.\r\nSo that's what I did!\r\nA tiny sneak peak (for full credits you'll need to play the actual game!):\r\n\r\n[![Animation of the credits roll](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-v1-20230322-credits.gif.gif)](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-v1-20230322-credits.gif.gif)\r\n\r\nDid I use all the tricks and hacks I had up my sleeve?\r\nMaybe.\r\nAm I

of Pincrediball to leave my machine.\r\nSo technically the \"alpha\" release has been done and tested.\r\nAnd it gave plenty of good feedback!\r\n\r\nWith that shortcut taken I can chug along towards the goals while sacrificing a little bit of quality.\r\nToday an intermezzo was on the menu.\r\nTomorrow we're having the next course: more Godot (gotchas), until we have a fully playable

beat!\r\n\r\n**_Jeroen_, March 21, 2023**\r\n\r\nYesterday I did the first bits of drag action.\r\nToday dropping stuff in the right places has been implemented.\r\nThere's a _metric_ ton of things left to smooth out, but let's start with the good parts.\r\nHere's what you can currently do:\r\n\r\n\u003Cvideo controls loop\u003E\r\n  \u003Csource

components\r\n\u003C\u002Fvideo\u003E\r\n\r\n_Super_ clunky, but you might get the basic idea?\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nSo we achieved quite a bit today:\r\n\r\n- ‚úî Dragging \"new\" components from the toolbox on the left to the playing field\r\n- ‚úî Dragging \"existing\" components on the playfield around\r\n- ‚úî Crude animation (green flashing area) of the valid drop area\r\n- ‚úî Fallback for when trying to drop outside the valid area\r\n\r\nIn addition to some other unrelated improvements:\r\n\r\n- ‚úî Music and SFX toggle buttons\r\n- ‚úî Run Playbook option will now reset the balls\r\n- ‚úî Official \"Stress Test\" option to fire off 10 balls\r\n- ‚úî Score reset when running playbooks\r\n- ‚úî Score disabled during a \"Stress Test\"\r\n\r\nBut there's a ton left that's not (yet) working surrounding Drag & Drop functionality:\r\n\r\n- ‚ùå Rotating certain components (bumper pills and wall corners) is missing\r\n- ‚ùå Toolbox items should be usable only the allotted number of times, not infinitely\r\n- ‚ùå You should _not_ be able to move items during a play run\r\n- ‚ùå Each Playbook should get a maximum number of seconds of runtime\r\n- ‚ùå A \"Stop Playbook\" option is needed\r\n- ‚ùå The \"Toolbox\" looks ugly and cramped, the layout needs work\r\n\r\nAnd given the late hour when I write this probably a few more things.\r\n\r\n### Kowalski, analysis!\r\n\r\nThe situation is... ~grim~ ~dire~ ~ugly~ ~promising~... frustrating?\r\nGodot and game development are a struggle (for a web developer by trade).\r\nAround every corner there's a new gotcha waiting, it seems.\r\nPerhaps my expectation of picking it up quickly given software development skills in other areas was unrealistic?\r\n\r\nEither way I'm proud to be pressing on.\r\nAnd

the foundations for the final app I encountered a super weird bug.\r\nThe ball would sometimes just jump off on its own.\r\nAnd sometimes it would \"sink\" into a platform.\r\n\r\nHere's what it the bug looks like (with some slow motion):\r\n\r\n[![animation of ball jumping up on its own](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-v1-20230315-physics-bugs.gif)](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-v1-20230315-physics-bugs.gif)\r\n\r\nAfter _hours_ of reading documentation, bisecting code, and debugging, I found the issue:\r\n**the texts and white rectangle to the _left_ of the machine can _sometimes_ cause the ball inside the machine to jump about**.\r\nAbsolutely nuts!\r\n\r\nSo I felt pretty unhappy about lost time.\r\nBut Annoyance made room for feeling relieved when I found a good minimal way to reproduce it.\r\n\r\nYet I was soon back to being even more salty again.\r\nHere's how.\r\nI wrote [a good reproducible scenario](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fjeroenheijmans\u002Frepro-godot-bounce-bug) and [GitHub issue for Godot](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fgodotengine\u002Fgodot\u002Fissues\u002F74940)\r\nA super short summary of the repro:\r\n\r\n- Create a specific (valid!) Node Tree\r\n- The tree involves combining GUI and Node2D nodes with physics\r\n- The presence of a white rectangle (!) next to the physics node, can affect if the physics _inside_ that node in weird ways\r\n\r\nHowever, I was informed in a one-sentence reply:\r\n\r\n\u003E I think this is not a bug, but **user error**.\r\n\r\nAhh, the good old \"_stupid user_\" excuse.\r\nBecause the wording straight up _blames_ the user for their problems.\r\n_They_ are in error.\r\nThis probably makes me extra salty because I've used that excuse myself in the past.\r\nAnd I'm now ashamed I used to do so.\r\n\r\nAnother user is slightly more friendly, but still also says:\r\n\r\n\u003E [This is not on] the engine [..., only] a **wrong expectation** [by you].\r\n\r\nWith a bit of empathy, the same meaning for both replies could be conveyed in a much friendlier way.\r\nPlus I _still_ think that it's reasonable to expect either the Editor or the Documentation to somehow help users avoid this pitfall.\r\nEspecially since behavior _inside_ a component was erratically affected by its siblings.\r\n\r\nThe second commenter ended with a bonus suggestion too:\r\n\r\n\u003E I recommend joining one of the communities to get feedback and support when looking for a solution and ending up with something that is not working.\r\n\r\nGuess that's a pretty strong hint that I should not be investing in any further interaction with Godot's GitHub community...\r\n\r\n### Happy\r\n\r\nEven through that loss of several hours, I still made some good progress!\r\nSo there's also reasons to be happy.\r\nAbove animated gif already showed it, here's also a still image of the current state of the game:\r\n\r\n[![Game screen with all components there](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-v1-20230315-snapshot.png)](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-v1-20230315-snapshot.png)\r\n\r\nLots of the basic interaction has been ported over from `prototype-007` as well.\r\nBut more importantly, the project and file structure are now well-organized and clean.\r\n\r\nI'm on schedule to have an alpha version of the game ready for _friendly_ testers near or shortly after the end of this week.\r\nAnd I'm pretty happy about that.\r\n\r\n### Next up\r\n\r\n[The GitHub Kanban Board](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Forgs\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fprojects\u002F1\u002Fviews\u002F1) will show you:\r\nthe alpha release is super-minimal.\r\nOnly the very basics are in there, and I'll use a User Test Script of sorts that fills in the gaps.\r\n\r\nSo (near) laser-focus on that alpha-release, is what's up next!\r\n",{"id":113,"isDraft":14,"order":114,"date":115,"title":116,"content":117},"post-2023-03-14",16,["Date","2023-03-14T00:00:00.000Z"],"Day 30: Work In Progress","## Day 30: Work In Progress\r\n\r\n**_Jeroen_, March 14, 2023**\r\n\r\n[Yesterday](#post-2023-03-13) I started the day with a devlog.\r\nIt outlined the goals and plan for this current stretch.\r\nSince the end of yesterday you can now publicly track progress [on the GitHub Kanban Board](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Forgs\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fprojects\u002F1\u002Fviews\u002F1).\r\n\r\nToday I'm building the foundations of the final codebase, using `prototype-007` as a reference point.\r\nWhich involves a ton of struggling with Godot's haphazard UI layout features.\r\nSo there's little time for an extended devlog.\r\nThese few paragraphs will have to do, dear reader!\r\n\r\nCatch you tomorrow!\r\nI'm off to get a wee bit more productivity out of today.\r\n",{"id":119,"isDraft":14,"order":120,"date":121,"title":122,"content":123},"post-2023-03-13",17,["Date","2023-03-13T00:00:00.000Z"],"Day 29: Planning","## Day 29: Planning\r\n\r\n**_Jeroen_, March 13, 2023**\r\n\r\n\u003E But Jeroen, isn't halfway into the project a bit late to create a plan!?\r\n\r\nWhy yes, it would be!\r\nBut: I already _had_ a plan, just not fully written down.\r\nAnd now that the end of my mini-sabbatical is nearing, and the plan is becoming fuzzy, it's time to revise it.\r\n\r\nToday I'm writing a devlog _fully_ at the _start_ of the day.\r\nAs I write, I'll create a plan for the remainder of the project.\r\nAfter that, I'll commit the rest of the day to taking the first steps.\r\n\r\n### Original plan\r\n\r\nSo, \"what was the 'original' not-written-down plan then?\", you may ask.\r\nWell, let's start with what I _did_ [write down at the start](#post-2023-02-16):\r\n\r\n[![early plans and brainstorm notes](\u002Fimg\u002Fv2023-02-14a-tipm-design-and-brainstorm.png)](\u002Fimg\u002Fv2023-02-14a-tipm-design-and-brainstorm.png)\r\n\r\nNote that the (respectively) pink and red highlighted items I considered most important.\r\nSo the plan was to:\r\n\r\n1. **Pick a name**, build a website + blog\r\n2. **Design and prototype** something, create primary sprites\r\n3. Set up something **temporary for sound and music**\r\n4. Create a **fun inner game loop**\r\n5. Learn the **game engine** needed for this\r\n6. Beta test it, **make sure it's _fun_** to play\r\n7. **Publish** and release to friends and family\r\n\r\nThe inner game loop would be:\r\n\r\n1. **Drag components around** to \"design\" a machine\r\n2. **Run the playbook** to see how it plays out\r\n\r\nThe secondary game loop:\r\n\r\n1. **Run the _inner_ game loop**\r\n2. **Check your score** and the medals you got\r\n3. **Unhappy**? Rinse and repeat. **Happy**? Go to next level.\r\n\r\nThe important thing is: **all of the above is still roughly relevant!**\r\nSo creating a fresh plan should be easy, right?!\r\n\r\n### Goals\r\n\r\nBefore talking about a plan, I need to talk about _goals_.\r\nLet's start with the _initial_ goals.\r\nWhen asked before the start, I'd say something like this:\r\n\r\n\u003E I develop software for a living.\r\n\u003E But I've never developed a _game_ before.\r\n\u003E So I want to try that.\r\n\u003E\r\n\u003E The goal would be to create one small game, end to end, nearly every part of it created by myself.\r\n\u003E And earn at least one euro with it, which can also be my own 1 euro: I just want to see what it takes to getting to _publishing_ a game.\r\n\r\nIt's also interesting to now what I did _not_ declare to be my goals:\r\n\r\n- That it should be a _good_ game;\r\n- That it should be a _successful_ game (monetarily or otherwise);\r\n- That it should be _completely_ finished;\r\n\r\nIt's _very_ tough to _not_ care about those things.\r\nAnd to be honest: I _do_ care about all three (in the order above).\r\n\r\nBut those things were _not_ my goals at the start.\r\nAnd I think that has remained unchanged.\r\nSo the main goals remain:\r\n\r\n- Experience what it's like to _develop_ a game;\r\n- Publish _something_ and earn at least one euro with it;\r\n\r\nKnowing my (unchanged) goals, it's time to create a fresh plan.\r\n\r\n### Revised plan\r\n\r\n[Prototype 007](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fprototype-007) after [Day 26](#post-2023-03-10) gives hope.\r\nIt should be good enough to help achieve above-stated goals.\r\nSo let's work from there.\r\nI should make it \"official\" too, and clean up a bit while doing so.\r\nThe first step should therefore be:\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 --\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003E 1. Move \"Prototype 007\" work over into the [core Pincrediball game repository](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fpincrediball).\r\n\u003E    Setting up a proper and clean project structure as I do so.\r\n\r\nAfter that I should basically have Prototype 007, but in a somewhat clean codebase.\r\nThe next steps would be to get to a playable state where I can ask friends to user test it.\r\nTo summarize:\r\n\r\n\u003E 2. Create a MUTeP: a Minimal User Testable Product.\r\n\u003E    Something that supports the _inner_ game loop.\r\n\u003E    Plus (possibly with workarounds) lets you imagine how the secondary game loop would work.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I just made the \"MUTeP\" acronym up.\r\n\r\nAfter getting test feedback, things shake up a bit.\r\nWho knows what testers will tell me?\r\nAnd what changes they require, affecting the plan.\r\nRegardless, the next step should be clear:\r\n\r\n\u003E 3. Handle feedback.\r\n\u003E    Fix the most glaring problems _that obstruct the end goals_.\r\n\u003E    Park all other suggestions and problems for the longer term.\r\n\r\nAfter this some extra feedback rounds may continue.\r\nBut looking at the main goals, the prime path to them has another focus.\r\nAt this point I should focus on making sure that _I myself_ am happy enough:\r\n\r\n\u003E 4. Make it publishable.\r\n\u003E    Make it good enough that I'm willing and happy (enough) to put it up on the web.\r\n\u003E    Including enough polish to make it presentable, without polishing forever.\r\n\r\nOriginally I thought I'd publish mainly (or even only) on Steam.\r\nBut I'm changing that a bit.\r\nI'm aiming to publish an alpha version with disclaimers on Itch.io first.\r\nAnd I'ld be happy with merely a wish-list page for Steam.\r\nIn short, the final step for during my mini-sabbatical would be:\r\n\r\n\u003E 5. Publish an early-access version.\r\n\u003E    Can be anywhere, as long as people can pay me an euro for it.\r\n\u003E    So that I might buy my own game, and accomplish the original goals.\r\n\r\nIt _feels_ possible to make these 5 steps in the remaining weeks.\r\nAnd it would feel great to do so, because I love the dopamine hit from achieving goals I set for myself.\r\n\r\nSo there you have it, that's the plan!\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- markdownlint-enable MD029 --\u003E\r\n\r\n### Beyond the plan\r\n\r\nMy aim with the aforementioned plan is to achieve the initial goals.\r\nThere are goals _beyond_ those.\r\nThere's two layers of goals:\r\n\r\n1. _Complete_ the game and make it _good_ enough for my own tastes.\r\n   And then also publish it on Steam.\r\n\r\n2.

finish an alpha version.\r\n\r\nSo technically that's _four_ goals, I suppose?\r\nAlthough also technically I did parts of \"1\" already, as you can tell from [\u002Fresources#bookmarks--godot-game-engine](\u002Fresources#bookmarks--godot-game-engine).\r\n\r\nI will allow myself (at least) one more day to \"muddle around\" in [`prototype-007` code](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fprototype-007).\r\nAfter that I really should be thinking about a somewhat clean codebase for the target alpha release of the game.\r\n\r\nFor now, let me put down my writing hat, and take a few moments to work through those goals.\r\n\r\n_A few ~moments~ hours later..._\r\n\r\n### Drag and Drop\r\n\r\nWhelp, that wasn't trivial.\r\nAnd as I feared when I just switched to Godot, them introducing a new major version would provide some hurdles.\r\nSo [a tiny underscore

tangible success.\r\nAs foreshadowed at the end of that post, today will be a shorter day.\r\nSo I was planning to spend some time on **research, instead of development**.\r\n\r\nMy plans include:\r\n\r\n- Structuring Research I've already done\r\n- Organizing my own glossary\r\n- Researching \"The Competition\" (other Pinball software and games)\r\n\r\nLet's get to the results, shall we!?\r\n\r\n### Structuring Research\r\n\r\nI've already built up a long list of online resources I've used so far.\r\nHigh time to put this into a better, version controlled format!\r\n\r\nThe main part of my saved research consists of... **bookmarks**!\r\nLet's keep it simple for now, and just integrate the most interesting ones with this website.\r\nSo without any ado:\r\n\r\nFind them all at [pincrediball.com\u002Fresources#bookmarks](\u002Fresources#bookmarks)!\r\n\r\n### Pinball Glossary\r\n\r\nIn my research I've found several glossaries for Pinball.\r\nNone of them summarize things in a way that suit me.\r\nSo it makes sense to create my own.\r\n\r\nSame holds here as for the \"Research\".\r\nIt makes the most sense (for now) to just add it to the website.\r\nSo, without any ado:\r\n\r\nFind the glossary at [pincrediball.com\u002Fresources#glossary](\u002Fresources#glossary)!\r\n\r\n### Researching \"The Competition\"\r\n\r\nIf there _are_ any direct competitors, I might as well check them out.\r\nMost likely there _will_ be software to create (and possibly also play) Pinball machines, which I also want to check out.\r\nIf there's time I might check some more general Pinball games.\r\n\r\nThis item was _last_ in my list, for good reason.\r\nIt's super open-ended, and could take hours, but also days or weeks!\r\n\r\nIn fact, this goal I've missed for today.\r\nI'll put it into the (forthcoming) blog post on all sorts of random ideas I still have.\r\nBut for now: there's not much more to say.\r\n\r\n### Summarizing\r\n\r\nRight.\r\nShort days are short.\r\nShorter even than you'd think.\r\nAnd I _really_ want to wrap up this post, _before_ I leave for social engagements.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'll revisit this post and the linked resources later in the day.\r\nBut most likely... _this will be it_.\r\nAnd tomorrow should be another day of actual _development_ work.\r\n\r\nUntil

We're about to dive deep.\r\n\r\n### 1. Designing the tutorial machine\r\n\r\nDesigning Pinball machines is a skill on its own.\r\nI have no such skill, but I've tried to do a base level of research.\r\nAmongst others, having checked [several PAPAPinball YouTube \"Machine Tutorials\"](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=XSw7fK6x1mw&list=PL-WQLGFMr97CQpOQDEvRqAiSqcvSuK11h&index=3)\r\nI see several aspects of a good Pinball machine:\r\n\r\n- **Theme** that's appealing (often tied to an existing brand, like \"Batman\" or \"Jurassic Park\");\r\n- **Backplate** with artwork around the theme;\r\n- **Quests**: hitting specific targets in specific orders, in a way that's also fun and challenging;\r\n- **Toys** are extra-special (often gimicky and theme-related) components of the machine that do something crazy when hit;\r\n- **Balance** between how hard goals are to hit (and how big a chance you have to drain the ball), and how many points they give;\r\n- [**Flipper tricks**](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=r_7TQ6wRZdw&list=PL-WQLGFMr97DnxeE1Rmi-wAwa-Vm7D-7i) should allow skilled players to be better at the game;\r\n- **Multi-ball** mode is usually a goal to work towards, preferably when **\"multipliers\"** are enabled;\r\n- **Basic components** that _must_ be included:\r\n  plunger (with plunger lane and a gate),\r\n  flippers,\r\n  balls,\r\n  lanes,\r\n  spinners,\r\n  bumpers,\r\n  drop targets,\r\n  slingshots,\r\n  and rollovers.\r\n- **Extra components** should probably also be included:\r\n  backbox and display,\r\n  outlanes,\r\n  ramps,\r\n  gates,\r\n  and kickbacks.\r\n- **Skill Shots** (plunging the initial ball at a particular speed to hit a particular target) are perfect for Pincrediball too.\r\n  Especially in the tutorial levels, the \"Playbook\" could contain a precise skill shot.\r\n  This makes it super fun to place the initial components in a very precise location.\r\n\r\nWe'll start with designing the theme, backplate, and quests.\r\nOne theme per \"stage\" of the game, so multiple levels are on the same theme.\r\nThe _Tutorial_ stage is up first.\r\nAlthough I don't have a good term or word for the theme yet, it'll revolve around:\r\n\r\n- Stick figures and a \"math\" paper background;\r\n- A limited color scheme with shades of blue, and some black and white;\r\n- Quests to build up a mini-comic lit up on the backplate;\r\n\r\nAt this point I'll stop writing out my thoughts on this blog post.\r\nIt's time to grab a tool to design the initial art!\r\n\r\n_...a few ~moments~ hours later_:\r\n\r\n[![Pinball machine in progress](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-007-figma.png)](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-007-figma.png)\r\n\r\nThis gives me something to work with!\r\nInteresting notes about the design:\r\n\r\n- The plunger lane includes an amber-colored gate that should be \"one-way\" for the ball;\r\n- The three gates at the top are for points, and to be placed by the player in the game to create high scores;\r\n- There's a tiny start for stick-figure art in the main area, which will indicate quest progress;\r\n- I'm a noob at Figma, yet still made it work decently well!\r\n\r\nI want to continue tweaking this design, but I _must_ move on.\r\nThere's still two goals left for today.\r\nTime for a quick break, and then on to the next part.\r\n\r\n### 2. Putting it into Godot\r\n\r\nFor some reason I figured that having SVG's in Figma would make it easy to import everything into Godot.\r\nI was half right.\r\nThe _wrong_ half.\r\n\r\nImporting the \"Art\" as textures was very easy.\r\n\r\nBut the important half was not so easy; perhaps more research is needed?\r\nI was hoping the SVG paths would be useful as collision shapes.\r\nEspecially the bezier curves seemed logical for a pinball machine.\r\nI set myself certain goals for today, and getting this bit perfect would hold me back.\r\n\r\nSo, I went the labor-intensive route.\r\nImporting the design of the machine in chunks from Figma.\r\nAnd after that... _manually tracing over those shapes again_, to create the collision polygons.\r\nSo...\r\n\r\n_...a few ~moments~ hours later_:\r\n\r\n[![Pinball machine in progress](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-007-godot.png)](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-007-godot.png)\r\n\r\nThat at least should work to some degree!\r\nLet's have a look, shall we?\r\n\r\n### 3. Allow plunging a ball\r\n\r\nTime to program a little bit of interactivity.\r\nThe plan was as follows:\r\n\r\n- A \"Plunge\" button that spawns a ball and shoots it into the field;\r\n- **Bonus:** Flippers that just constantly, well, flipper;\r\n\r\nAfter a bunch of trial and error;\r\nafter a ton of Godot 3.x to 4.0 translation;\r\nafter loads of debugging and tweaking;\r\nin short after...\r\n\r\n_...a few ~moments~ hours later_:\r\n\r\n\u003Cvideo controls loop\u003E\r\n  \u003Csource src=\"\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-007.mp4\" type=\"video\u002Fmp4\" \u002F\u003E\r\n  Video recording of a basic pinball machine and dozens of balls\r\n\u003C\u002Fvideo\u003E\r\n\r\nI have a ton of concerns still.\r\nMost notably if this will be deterministic enough for my core game idea.\r\nBut concerns be damned, **I'm pretty content with this result!**\r\n\r\n### Recap\r\n\r\nIn short, I achieved what I set out to do:\r\n(1) design a machine, (2) put it in Godot, and (3) have basic ball physics.\r\nSetting the goals at the start certainly helped.\r\nTomorrow I might go for a more free-form day, but soon after I'll certainly use this same trick again.\r\n\r\nIf you made it this far into my stream-of-consciousness post:\r\nI salute you!\r\nYou're the best.\r\n\r\nOn to the next bits!\r\n",{"key":164,"posts":165},"2023, week 9",[166,172,178,184,190],{"id":167,"isDraft":14,"order":168,"date":169,"title":170,"content":171},"post-2023-03-03",24,["Date","2023-03-03T00:00:00.000Z"],"Day 19: Rest day","## Day 19: Rest day\r\n\r\n**_Jeroen_, March 03, 2023**\r\n\r\nGot up an hour later than I wanted.\r\nEnjoyed a visit from a friend, preferred chatting over working on the project.\r\nSome spinning while watching Rick & Morty.\r\nAnd some LEGO Star War with the Mrs.\r\n\r\nIn short: not much game dev was done today.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I'll catch up over the weekend.\r\nOr maybe I'll just reboot next week.\r\nI'm fine with either, it's a _vacation_ project, after all.\r\nWe'll see!\r\n",{"id":173,"isDraft":14,"order":174,"date":175,"title":176,"content":177},"post-2023-03-02",25,["Date","2023-03-02T00:00:00.000Z"],"Day 18: Prototype 006 with Godot","## Day 18: Prototype 006 with Godot\r\n\r\n**_Jeroen_, March 02, 2023**\r\n\r\nToday I followed advice from friends.\r\nGodot got several more recommendations.\r\nAnd right after I decided to take it for a spin, [Godot 4.0 was released](https:\u002F\u002Fgodotengine.org\u002Farticle\u002Fgodot-4-0-sets-sail\u002F).\r\n\r\n\u003E After 3+ years of breaking and rebuilding from the ground up, a complete core overhaul and a full engine rewrite: **Welcome to the start of Godot 4!**\r\n\r\nSo that's both good and bad.\r\nIt's nice that I join in right when a boost in new modern features is released.\r\n\r\nBut as I suspected, it's less nice that we're now in a state of limbo.\r\nDocumentation has warnings all over the place that they might still be out of date.\r\nOnline examples are thoroughly broken.\r\nAll forum posts and Q&A online still uses the 3.x way of things.\r\n\r\nBut if I download the 3.x LTS version, I'm learning obsolete skills from the get go.\r\nSo Godot 4.0 it was.\r\n\r\n### Prototype?

Prototype 005\r\n\r\n**_Jeroen_, February 27, 2023**\r\n\r\nFirst day of week 3 of the project, day 15 of the project.\r\n\r\nI'm writing an early devlog today.\r\nAfter writing this I will probably _continue_ development.\r\nBut I feel like I reached a checkpoint _now_, so a recap is in order.\r\n\r\n### Prototype 004\r\n\r\nLooking at the overview of posts you may wonder: \"What happened to prototype 004?\".\r\nGlad you asked!\r\nIn fact, on [Day 12](#post-2023-02-24) I combined Phaser with Svelte;\r\nonly at the end of that day did I \"promote\" it to [its own prototype repository](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Forgs\u002Fpincrediball\u002Frepositories?q=prototype).\r\nQuite likely `prototype-004` will even grow into the end result at some point.\r\n\r\n### Ladies and Gentlemen: Prototype Number 005!\r\n\r\nSo, today I got up fresh and early.\r\nThe main problem to tackle: **some (more) determinism** in runs.\r\nOtherwise the core game loop (precisely placing parts so you get a high score) is no fun.\r\n\r\nDeterminism turns out to be quite difficult with MatterJS.\r\nBut that's only one problem.\r\nIt has no Continuous Collision Detection (CCD) either, causing the ball at high velocity to go _through_ walls.\r\nThis might get worse once I get to implementing flippers, I suspect.\r\nSo I was doubting my engine choice a bit.\r\n\r\nStill, after a productive morning, I found that things might be good enough for now.\r\nI tweaked the engine settings to a point where many parallel instances of my game would all give the same result.\r\nHere's [the \"proof\" of that](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fprototype-005):\r\n\r\n\u003Cvideo controls loop\u003E\r\n  \u003Csource

prototype made two things clear to me:\r\n\r\n- It gives enough _confidence_ to move forward with my current setup;\r\n- It causes enough _doubt_ that this engine should be the final choice for a _full_ game;\r\n\r\nIn short: a nice check point reached!\r\n\r\n### What's next?\r\n\r\nSo the next steps are to go \"all in\" on the current approach.\r\nMore specifically, my to do list is currently:\r\n\r\n- Design a good looking tutorial theme and pinball machine;\r\n- Integrate that design, Prototype 004, and Prototype nr. 5;\r\n- Allow the player to move bumpers around\r\n- Add flippers to the game;\r\n\r\nPerhaps a few sound effects to make working on this project a bit more fun too.\r\nI will roll up the rest of today's work in the next devlog entry either way.\r\nStay tuned!\r\n",{"key":197,"posts":198},"2023, week

that it sparked joy to play around with something else.\r\nHere's what I changed up for this pincrediball.com's website source code.\r\n\r\n### Prose TailwindCSS plugin\r\n\r\nTailwind resets styling, so you can reliably create Web Applications and Sites.\r\nThat's all great, but for long-form textual content it's actually painful to loose _all_ styling.\r\n[The Tailwind \"Prose\" plugin](https:\u002F\u002Ftailwindcss.com\u002Fdocs\u002Ftypography-plugin) aims to solve that, without compromising the reset of styles that Tailwind gives you.\r\n\r\nIt was just fine to write this devlog straight up with html and Tailwind classes.\r\nBut copy-pasting things like `mt-4` on each `\u003Cp\u003E` becomes tedious pretty quickly.\r\nThe Prose plugin fixes that nicely, and cleaned up my devlog source code considerably.\r\n\r\n### Markdown for blogging\r\n\r\nThis also enables the next step.\r\nMarkdown is a far nicer format to write blogposts in.\r\nI had noticed before that [`svelte.dev` uses markdown for their blog](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fsveltejs\u002Fsites\u002Ftree\u002Fmaster\u002Fsites\u002Fsvelte.dev\u002Fcontent\u002Fblog),\r\nwhich sparked my interest.\r\n\r\nAfter briefly trying the (rather nice!) [svelte-exmarkdown](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fssssota\u002Fsvelte-exmarkdown) library, I decided I needed a bit more control.\r\nSo I dove a bit deeper into how `svelte.dev` does things.\r\nAnd that setup is quite nice indeed, as it includes support for SSR and RSS.\r\n\r\nSo, I used a (much) simplified variant of that setup.\r\nAnd: it works like a breeze!\r\nAdding a blog post can now be as simple as [adding one `.md` file to the repository](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fpincrediball.com\u002Fcommit\u002F22f4cb509b4c4fbe3b81eb4089af522c21a14bb5)!\r\n\r\n### What's next?\r\n\r\nThat's all nice!\r\nBut what's next?\r\nShould I ever feel like getting side-tracked again, there's a few things left to tweak:\r\n\r\n- RSS feed would be nice;\r\n- Having `[slug]` based pages might be nice;\r\n- GitHub Action to `npm run build` would be nice;\r\n- GitHub Action to deploy GH-Pages should be nice;\r\n\r\nBut for now: let's stop procrastination and get back to building the game.\r\nShall

1\r\n\r\n**_Jeroen_, February 21, 2023**\r\n\r\nAfter [yesterday](#post-2023-02-20) several friends helped out with some rubber duck debugging.\r\nGot some great input on Slack and in other places about how I could wrangle the physics engine collisions into submission.\r\nAnd how much I should probably let go and embrace the chaos of a realistic engine.\r\n\r\nHowever, I still changed it up... for prototyping purposes!\r\n\r\nUsing PhaserJS and MatterJS might _still_ be the right way to go.\r\nBut I still wanted to try out how it feels to create a fully custom engine anyways.\r\n\r\nAnd while I was at that, I was also curious to see how far I can get with plain html, css, and JavaScript (and no _game_ engine).\r\nUsing SvelteKit and Tailwind, just for prototyping speed at the moment.\r\n\r\nI didn't get very far yet with writing the actual game loop and time ticker.\r\nBut I did do a bunch of good work on an initial game layout.\r\nIt's far from polished, but (even though polish might be 80% of the work?!) that's for later.\r\nHere's the initial results:\r\n\r\n[![Game in a browser

I go the PhaserJS route after all, I might be able to use this setup in conjunction with it.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm sorry to say: that's all for today, folks!\r\n\r\nAs a final footnote for today's devlog: I also decided to open source the prototypes.\r\nSo you can fully see me fumbling about.\r\nWriting all sorts of just-make-it-work code.\r\nYou can find [all the repositories in the Pincrediball GitHub organization](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball).\r\nAnd for my most loyal readers (hi mum!), here's a quick peek at it, with just a random screenshot of me hacking about in prototype

the project.\r\nAfter a week of \"meta\" stuff, designing, and a super-light prototype, today was spent on more in-depth prototyping.\r\n\r\nI'm very happy with what I _did_, but only moderately so with the _result_.\r\nHere, have a look for yourself first:\r\n\r\n\u003Cvideo controls loop\u003E\r\n  \u003Csource src=\"\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-002.mp4\" type=\"video\u002Fmp4\"

prototypes.)\u003C\u002Fsmall\u003E\r\n\r\nLet's summarize what I learned during today's experiments, starting with the positives:\r\n\r\n- ‚úÖ SvelteKit will be a great \"bearer\" of the game\r\n- ‚úÖ Using plain html\u002Fcss\u002Fjs for parts of the app will likely turn out great\r\n- ‚úÖ Tailwind enables for fast menu's and other UI\r\n- ‚úÖ I got _something_ looking like Pinball physics to work\r\n\r\nHowever, I have many concerns after today:\r\n\r\n- ‚ùå MatterJS physics is wonky ls going _through_ static bounds or getting stuck\r\n- ‚ùå Level editing is cumbersome in (vanilla) Phaser, without any tools\r\n- ‚ùå Curved shapes and SVG paths are a _major_ pain to use\r\n\r\nI'm not so sure yet where to go from here.\r\nHave I learned that I need to go back to my original idea?\r\nBuilding a super-simple physics engine of my own, to make everything far more deterministic and reliable?\r\nOr should I stick with out-of-the-box physics and just deal with the issues?\r\n\r\nPerhaps a night's sleep and some distraction will bring clarity.\r\n",{"key":230,"posts":231},"2023, week

on!\r\n\r\n**_Jeroen_, February 16, 2023**\r\n\r\nToday it's time to figure out an engine to use.\r\nI'm leaning heavily towards [PhaserJS](https:\u002F\u002Fphaser.io\u002F) (the main alternatives being Godot and Unity),\r\nbecause it allows me to tap into my existing web development and JavaScript skills.\r\n\r\nI'm mostly doing tutorials and reading documentation, so no exciting updates from today for the devlog.\r\nThat does give me a minute to share my rough \"plan\" I created earlier in the project.\r\nHere it is:\r\n\r\n[![Brainstorm overview divided in 6 sections: Design,

brainstorm, but it became a rough \"plan\".\r\nEach of the six parts is roughly a time box of one week.\r\nI'm starting with \"Design\" this week, but currently borrowing a bit from the next goal: \"Game Loop \u002F Engine\".\r\n\r\nStuff's color coded too: the red stuff is Must-Haves, yellow Should-Haves, and green the Nice-to-Haves.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\nToo optimistic?\r\nProbably.\r\nBut let's see how far we'll get, shall we?!\r\n",{"id":245,"isDraft":14,"order":246,"date":247,"title":248,"content":249},"post-2023-02-15",36,["Date","2023-02-15T00:00:00.000Z"],"Day 3: Website first?","## Day 3: Website

it's in the end somehow part of the _critical path_ though?\r\n\r\nBut regardless of whether it was _The Right Thing_ to do right now, it _was_ very effective!\r\nI mean: you're looking at the very result right now.\r\n\r\nThe website was built with SvelteKit and TailwindCSS, which was rather efficient because I recently used it for both of my other recent side-projects:\r\n[Tierdom](https:\u002F\u002Ftierdom.jeroenheijmans.nl) and [vesta.infi.nl](https:\u002F\u002Fvesta.infi.nl).\r\nBut not before I spent the entire morning learning some more Figma skills to do the entire design first.\r\n\r\nI only bought the domain name, used\r\n[GitHub pages with a custom and apex domain](https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.github.com\u002Fen\u002Fpages\u002Fconfiguring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site\u002Fabout-custom-domains-and-github-pages#using-an-apex-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)\r\nfor hosting the whole thing.\r\nWhich, after the usual DNS hassle, works quite well!\r\n\r\nAll this means three important things:\r\n\r\n- I can _comfortably share_ the plans with the world\r\n- I am _on schedule_ for week 1's plans\r\n- I have _no excuses left_ to procrastinate prototyping\r\n\r\nSo let's end this third day with some initial social media posts and links to this website.\r\n\r\n**And

high was by _doing essential things disguised as non-essential things_.\r\nBy this I mean I tried to incorporate essential things (work on the designs and game idea) into far less essential things (that were enjoyable to do).\r\n\r\nFirst thing I did was to **redo the main game screen's design**.\r\nFor fun I've shared that on the (current, at the time of writing) [home page](\u002F).\r\nAfter
