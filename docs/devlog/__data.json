Mini-game!\r\n\r\nI named it \"prototype 006\" and might still put the code online as such.\r\nBut I mainly set out to just build a tiny game with Godot.\r\n\r\nAs a teenager I'd lie on my back in my room, endlessly tossing a small ball in the air.\r\nThe goal?\r\nTo get as close to the ceiling as possible, _without_ actually hitting it.\r\n\r\nSo I made it into a tiny Godot game.\r\nReally wanted to make it playable in the browser, more on that in a second.\r\nFirst, an example of what it looks like:\r\n\r\n[![Animated gif of a ball bouncing in the air for score](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-006.gif)](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-006.gif)\r\n\r\nYou press `[SPACE]` or `[LEFT MOUSE BUTTON]` for 0 to 2000 milliseconds to send it flying up.\r\nThe higher you get, the more points you score.\r\nIf you hit the ceiling?\r\nZero points.\r\n\r\nActually fun to build.\r\nMostly without frustration.\r\nBetter than Phaser, certainly.\r\nThis is looking promising!\r\n\r\n#### Godot exports\r\n\r\nThe actual exporting to platforms is a bit more finnicky.\r\nAndroid requires the SDK so I'm yet to try that.\r\niOS similarly likely needs special stuff.\r\n\r\nThe `.exe` Windows version was somehwat easy.\r\nIt includes the entire Godot engine though.\r\nSo my super-simple game becomes 45+ MB: not great.\r\n\r\nThe \"html5\" version is even worse.\r\nThe WASM file also clocks in at similar size.\r\nBut worse: it requires quite modern but certainly not ubiquitous Web Server headers.\r\nThe response from the Godot team was, understandably but frustratingly:\r\n[\"This is a Web Server problem that Web Servers should fix\"](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fgodotengine\u002Fgodot\u002Fissues\u002F69020#issuecomment-1324253401).\r\n\r\nIt seems that [support for needed headers](https:\u002F\u002Fstackoverflow.com\u002Fq\u002F68609682\u002F419956) won't easily work on GitHub Pages.\r\nSo no runnable version of the game on this devlog for now.\r\n\r\n#### Now what?\r\n\r\nIt'd be really sad if my final game wouldn't run well in browsers.\r\nBoth a demo version on the website, as well as an itch.io version, would be problematic.\r\nBut I don't think I'll let that hold me back.\r\nTomorrow I'll sleep in, and at some point go back to toying with Godot.\r\nMainly because it was _fun_ to do so!\r\n",{"id":16,"date":17,"title":18,"content":19},"post-2023-03-01",["Date","2023-03-01T00:00:00.000Z"],"Day 17: Giving up","## Day 17: Giving up\r\n\r\n### **Jeroen**, March 01, 2023\r\n\r\nI'm giving up.\r\n\r\nThe past few days have been extremely frustrating.\r\nI'm spending _days_ on trivial things like [making objects only movable by a player](https:\u002F\u002Fgamedev.stackexchange.com\u002Fquestions\u002F204691\u002Fhow-to-make-object-movable-only-by-the-player).\r\nIn those days I'm also loosing _hours_ on how utterly inconsistent and unpredictable the Phaser and Matter API are for nontrivial things.\r\n\r\nSummarizing those two things differently:\r\n\r\n1.

**Jeroen**, February 27, 2023\r\n\r\nFirst day of week 3 of the project, day 15 of the project.\r\n\r\nI'm writing an early devlog today.\r\nAfter writing this I will probably _continue_ development.\r\nBut I feel like I reached a checkpoint _now_, so a recap is in order.\r\n\r\n#### Prototype 004\r\n\r\nLooking at the overview of posts you may wonder: \"What happened to prototype 004?\".\r\nGlad you asked!\r\nIn fact, on [Day 12](#post-2023-02-24) I combined Phaser with Svelte;\r\nonly at the end of that day did I \"promote\" it to [its own prototype repository](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Forgs\u002Fpincrediball\u002Frepositories?q=prototype).\r\nQuite likely `prototype-004` will even grow into the end result at some point.\r\n\r\n#### Ladies and Gentlemen: Prototype Number 005!\r\n\r\nSo, today I got up fresh and early.\r\nThe main problem to tackle: **some (more) determinism** in runs.\r\nOtherwise the core game loop (precisely placing parts so you get a high score) is no fun.\r\n\r\nDeterminism turns out to be quite difficult with MatterJS.\r\nBut that's only one problem.\r\nIt has no Continuous Collision Detection (CCD) either, causing the ball at high velocity to go _through_ walls.\r\nThis might get worse once I get to implementing flippers, I suspect.\r\nSo I was doubting my engine choice a bit.\r\n\r\nStill, after a productive morning, I found that things might be good enough for now.\r\nI tweaked the engine settings to a point where many parallel instances of my game would all give the same result.\r\nHere's [the \"proof\" of that](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fprototype-005):\r\n\r\n\u003Cvideo controls loop\u003E\r\n  \u003Csource

prototype made two things clear to me:\r\n\r\n- It gives enough _confidence_ to move forward with my current setup;\r\n- It causes enough _doubt_ that this engine should be the final choice for a _full_ game;\r\n\r\nIn short: a nice check point reached!\r\n\r\n#### What's next?\r\n\r\nSo the next steps are to go \"all in\" on the current approach.\r\nMore specifically, my to do list is currently:\r\n\r\n- Design a good looking tutorial theme and pinball machine;\r\n- Integrate that design, Prototype 004, and Prototype nr. 5;\r\n- Allow the player to move bumpers around\r\n- Add flippers to the game;\r\n\r\nPerhaps a few sound effects to make working on this project a bit more fun too.\r\nI will roll up the rest of today's work in the next devlog entry either way.\r\nStay tuned!\r\n",{"key":31,"posts":32},"2023, week 8",[33,38,43,48,53],{"id":34,"date":35,"title":36,"content":37},"post-2023-02-24",["Date","2023-02-24T00:00:00.000Z"],"Day 12: Combining Phaser and

uses some of the domain entities from prototype-003.\r\nAnd it includes a Phaser scene for the actual Pinball machine.\r\n\r\nFor lack of time (the weekend calls for other obligations) I'll just use a static screenshot for the blog:\r\n\r\n[![Game in a browser window](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-004-part1.png)](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-004-part1.png)\r\n\r\nThe rest of today

hoped.\r\nFor a large part because I procrastinated and let myself get side tracked though.\r\nWhat all that does mean is that I need to re-evaluate my goals and approach next week.\r\n\r\nWhat's super important is that the machine becomes more deterministic.\r\nThe whole \"automata player\" and game loop idea falls apart if different runs of the automata have different outcomes.\r\nEither the setup needs to become (more) deterministic, or the game loop has to change.\r\nOr my goals for the project need to change...\r\n\r\nGot a weekend to chew on that though.\r\n",{"id":39,"date":40,"title":41,"content":42},"post-2023-02-23",["Date","2023-02-23T00:00:00.000Z"],"Day 11: Sidetracked with Markdown","## Day 11: Sidetracked with Markdown\r\n\r\n### **Jeroen**, February 23, 2023\r\n\r\nI let myself get sidetracked...\r\n\r\nNot sure how much it is to procrastinate working on the actual game.\r\nBut I _am_ sure that it sparked joy to play around with something else.\r\nHere's what I changed up for this pincrediball.com's website source code.\r\n\r\n#### Prose TailwindCSS plugin\r\n\r\nTailwind resets styling, so you can reliably create Web Applications and Sites.\r\nThat's all great, but for long-form textual content it's actually painful to loose _all_ styling.\r\n[The Tailwind \"Prose\" plugin](https:\u002F\u002Ftailwindcss.com\u002Fdocs\u002Ftypography-plugin) aims to solve that, without compromising the reset of styles that Tailwind gives you.\r\n\r\nIt was just fine to write this devlog straight up with html and Tailwind classes.\r\nBut copy-pasting things like `mt-4` on each `\u003Cp\u003E` becomes tedious pretty quickly.\r\nThe Prose plugin fixes that nicely, and cleaned up my devlog source code considerably.\r\n\r\n#### Markdown for blogging\r\n\r\nThis also enables the next step.\r\nMarkdown is a far nicer format to write blogposts in.\r\nI had noticed before that [`svelte.dev` uses markdown for their blog](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fsveltejs\u002Fsites\u002Ftree\u002Fmaster\u002Fsites\u002Fsvelte.dev\u002Fcontent\u002Fblog),\r\nwhich sparked my interest.\r\n\r\nAfter briefly trying the (rather nice!) [svelte-exmarkdown](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fssssota\u002Fsvelte-exmarkdown) library, I decided I needed a bit more control.\r\nSo I dove a bit deeper into how `svelte.dev` does things.\r\nAnd that setup is quite nice indeed, as it includes support for SSR and RSS.\r\n\r\nSo, I used a (much) simplified variant of that setup.\r\nAnd: it works like a breeze!\r\nAdding a blog post can now be as simple as [adding one `.md` file to the repository](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fpincrediball.com\u002Fcommit\u002F22f4cb509b4c4fbe3b81eb4089af522c21a14bb5)!\r\n\r\n#### What's next?\r\n\r\nThat's all nice!\r\nBut what's next?\r\nShould I ever feel like getting side-tracked again, there's a few things left to tweak:\r\n\r\n- RSS feed would be nice;\r\n- Having `[slug]` based pages might be nice;\r\n- GitHub Action to `npm run build` would be nice;\r\n- GitHub Action to deploy GH-Pages should be nice;\r\n\r\nBut for now: let's stop procrastination and get back to building the game.\r\nShall

February 21, 2023\r\n\r\nAfter [yesterday](#post-2023-02-20) several friends helped out with some rubber duck debugging.\r\nGot some great input on Slack and in other places about how I could wrangle the physics engine collisions into submission.\r\nAnd how much I should probably let go and embrace the chaos of a realistic engine.\r\n\r\nHowever, I still changed it up... for prototyping purposes!\r\n\r\nUsing PhaserJS and MatterJS might _still_ be the right way to go.\r\nBut I still wanted to try out how it feels to create a fully custom engine anyways.\r\n\r\nAnd while I was at that, I was also curious to see how far I can get with plain html, css, and JavaScript (and no _game_ engine).\r\nUsing SvelteKit and Tailwind, just for prototyping speed at the moment.\r\n\r\nI didn't get very far yet with writing the actual game loop and time ticker.\r\nBut I did do a bunch of good work on an initial game layout.\r\nIt's far from polished, but (even though polish might be

Using plain html\u002Fcss\u002Fjs for parts of the app will likely turn out great\r\n- ✅ Tailwind enables for fast menu's and other UI\r\n- ✅ I got _something_ looking like Pinball physics to work\r\n\r\nHowever, I have many concerns after today:\r\n\r\n- ❌ MatterJS physics is wonky ls going _through_ static bounds or getting stuck)\r\n- ❌ Level editing is cumbersome in (vanilla) Phaser, without any tools\r\n- ❌ Curved shapes and SVG paths are a _major_ pain to use\r\n\r\nI'm not so sure yet where to go from here.\r\nHave I learned that I need to go back to my original

2023\r\n\r\nToday it's time to figure out an engine to use.\r\nI'm leaning heavily towards [PhaserJS](https:\u002F\u002Fphaser.io\u002F) (the main alternatives being Godot and Unity),\r\nbecause it allows me to tap into my existing web development and JavaScript skills.\r\n\r\nI'm mostly doing tutorials and reading documentation, so no exciting updates from today for the devlog.\r\nThat does give me a minute to share my rough \"plan\" I created earlier in the project.\r\nHere it is:\r\n\r\n[![Brainstorm overview divided in 6 sections: Design, Graphics\u002FArt, Sound\u002FMusic, Game Loop\u002FEngine, Polish, Publish](\u002Fimg\u002Fv2023-02-14a-tipm-brainstorm.png)](\u002Fimg\u002Fv2023-02-14a-tipm-brainstorm.png)\r\n\r\nIt started as a brainstorm, but it became a rough \"plan\".\r\nEach of the six parts is roughly a timebox of one week.\r\nI'm starting with \"Design\" this week, but currently borrowing a bit from the next goal: \"Game Loop \u002F Engine\".\r\n\r\nStuff's color coded too: the red stuff is Must-Haves, yellow Should-Haves, and green the Nice-to-Haves.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\nToo optimistic?\r\nProbably.\r\nBut let's see how far we'll get, shall we?!\r\n",{"id":72,"date":73,"title":74,"content":75},"post-2023-02-15",["Date","2023-02-15T00:00:00.000Z"],"Day 3: Website first?","## Day 3: Website first?\r\n\r\n### **Jeroen**, February 15, 2023\r\n\r\nContinuing from day 2 with a focus on _fun_ activities, I decided to finish up the website.\r\nThis time I don't think I can claim anymore that it's in the end somehow part of the _critical path_ though?\r\n\r\nBut regardless of whether it was _The Right Thing_ to do right now, it _was_ very effective!\r\nI mean: you're looking at the very result right now.\r\n\r\nThe website was built with SvelteKit and TailwindCSS, which was rather efficient because I recently used it for both of my other recent side-projects:\r\n[Tierdom](https:\u002F\u002Ftierdom.jeroenheijmans.nl) and [vesta.infi.nl](https:\u002F\u002Fvesta.infi.nl).\r\nBut not before I spent the entire morning learning some more Figma skills to do the entire design first.\r\n\r\nI only bought the domain name, used\r\n[GitHub pages with a custom and apex domain](https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.github.com\u002Fen\u002Fpages\u002Fconfiguring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site\u002Fabout-custom-domains-and-github-pages#using-an-apex-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)\r\nfor hosting the whole thing.\r\nWhich, after the usual DNS hassle, works quite well!\r\n\r\nAll this means three important things:\r\n\r\n- I can _comfortably share_ the plans with the world\r\n- I am _on schedule_ for week 1's plans\r\n- I have _no excuses left_ to procrastinate prototyping\r\n\r\nSo let's end this third day with some initial social media posts and links to this website.\r\n\r\n**And tomorrow: we prototype!**\r\n",{"id":77,"date":78,"title":79,"content":80},"post-2023-02-14",["Date","2023-02-14T00:00:00.000Z"],"Day 2: Now we're getting somewhere!","## Day 2: Now we're getting somewhere!\r\n\r\n### **Jeroen**, February 14, 2023\r\n\r\nSecond day I allowed myself to get side-tracked.\r\nI decided that the best way to keep motivation high was by _doing essential things disguised as non-essential things_.\r\nBy this I mean I tried to incorporate essential things (work on the designs and game idea) into far less essential things (that were enjoyable to do).\r\n\r\nFirst thing I did was to **redo the main game screen's design**.\r\nFor fun I've shared that on the (current, at the time of writing) [home page](\u002F).\r\nAfter that I took care of a bunch of other non-essential (but fun!) things:\r\n\r\n- ✅ Logo &amp; Banner designed\r\n- ✅ YouTube channel claimed\r\n- ✅ Itch.io account claimed\r\n- ✅ Socials set up\r\n- ✅ SteamWorks application submitted (and $100 fee paid...)\r\n\r\nIt was a _fun_ day with this too, as you can tell from [my related toot](https:\u002F\u002Fmastodon.social\u002F@jeroenheijmans\u002F109865321998439644).\r\nAnd it really gave me a bunch of inspiration and energy to continue on!\r\n",{"id":82,"date":83,"title":84,"content":85},"post-2023-02-13",["Date","2023-02-13T00:00:00.000Z"],"Day 1: Gotta start

Bowl... in the GMT+1 timezone!\r\nSo was up until 04:30 (that's AM for y'all), naturally this wasn't the most productive day.\r\n\r\nBut the most important thing got done: I got _started_ on the project!\r\nPlus several important things got done nonetheless, as [I wrote on Mastodon](https:\u002F\u002Fmastodon.social\u002F@jeroenheijmans\u002F109859902264743330):\r\n\r\n- ✅ Brainstorm done\r\n- ✅ Rough plan created\r\n- ✅ Name chosen\r\n- ✅ Domain bought!\r\n- ✅ GitHub org and repo's claimed\r\n- ✅ Social media names claimed\r\n- ✅ Game loop basics designed\r\n- ✅ Initial designs\r\n\r\nIn the end would call day 1 a success!\r\n",[5,10,15,20,25,33,38,43,48,53,61,66,71,76,81]],"uses":{}}]}
