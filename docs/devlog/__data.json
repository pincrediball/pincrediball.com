today.\r\nWhich brings me to say...\r\n\r\n**Whelp!**\r\nDoing drag and drop in Godot is not easy ~at all~.\r\nThe very first steps are trivial.\r\nMany tutorials describe how it's done.\r\nBut the edges... are rough.\r\nAnd when I get distracted, I get _distracted_;\r\nand I'll write an entire sample of [how Drag & Drop could be

because I worked hard, I made progress, and learned new things.\r\nBut a \"grumble\" nonetheless, because tomorrow will be another full day of dragging this feature along.\r\nLet's hope I'll get it

start!\r\n\r\nSome other changes, next to music and sound:\r\n\r\n- The \"Playbook\" top left is now \"real\" and connected;\r\n- The \"Run Playbook\" button will reset score and flippers;\r\n- The \"Your Score\" part has been better aligned with \"Score Targets\";\r\n- Basics for level medals and level progression are in place.\r\n\r\n#### Alpha release then?\r\n\r\nSo one notable thing is

Mixed feelings","## Day 31: Mixed feelings\r\n\r\n### **Jeroen**, March 15, 2023\r\n\r\nI feel good about today's progress.\r\nAnd I feel pretty salty about today's progress.\r\nMixed feelings, I'd say.\r\n\r\n#### Salty\r\n\r\nBuilding the foundations for the final app I encountered a super weird bug.\r\nThe ball would sometimes just jump off on its own.\r\nAnd sometimes it would \"sink\" into a platform.\r\n\r\nHere's what it the bug looks like (with some slow motion):\r\n\r\n[![animation of ball jumping up on its own](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-v1-20230315-physics-bugs.gif)](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-v1-20230315-physics-bugs.gif)\r\n\r\nAfter _hours_ of reading documentation, bisecting code, and debugging, I found the issue:\r\n**the texts and white rectangle to the _left_ of the machine can _sometimes_ cause the ball inside the machine to jump about**.\r\nAbsolutely nuts!\r\n\r\nSo I felt pretty unhappy about lost time.\r\nBut Annoyance made room for feeling relieved when I found a good minimal way to reproduce it.\r\n\r\nYet I was soon back to being even more salty again.\r\nHere's how.\r\nI wrote [a good reproducible scenario](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fjeroenheijmans\u002Frepro-godot-bounce-bug) and [GitHub issue for Godot](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fgodotengine\u002Fgodot\u002Fissues\u002F74940)\r\nA super short summary of the repro:\r\n\r\n- Create a specific (valid!) Node Tree\r\n- The tree involves combining GUI and Node2D nodes with physics\r\n- The presence of a white rectangle (!) next to the physics node, can affect if the physics _inside_ that node in weird ways\r\n\r\nHowever, I was informed in a one-sentence reply:\r\n\r\n\u003E I think this is not a bug, but **user error**.\r\n\r\nAhh, the good old \"_stupid user_\" excuse.\r\nBecause the wording straight up _blames_ the user for their problems.\r\n_They_ are in error.\r\nThis probably makes me extra salty because I've used that excuse myself in the past.\r\nAnd I'm now ashamed I used to do so.\r\n\r\nAnother user is slightly more friendly, but still also says:\r\n\r\n\u003E [This is not on] the engine [..., only] a **wrong expectation** [by you].\r\n\r\nWith a bit of empathy, the same meaning for both replies could be conveyed in a much friendlier way.\r\nPlus I _still_ think that it's reasonable to expect either the Editor or the Documentation to somehow help users avoid this pitfall.\r\nEspecially since behavior _inside_ a component was erratically affected by its siblings.\r\n\r\nThe second commenter ended with a bonus suggestion too:\r\n\r\n\u003E I recommend joining one of the communities to get feedback and support when looking for a solution and ending up with something that is not working.\r\n\r\nGuess that's a pretty strong hint that I should not be investing in any further interaction with Godot's GitHub community...\r\n\r\n#### Happy\r\n\r\nEven through that loss of several hours, I still made some good progress!\r\nSo there's also reasons to be happy.\r\nAbove animated gif already showed it, here's also a still image of the current state of the game:\r\n\r\n[![Game screen with all components there](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-v1-20230315-snapshot.png)](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-v1-20230315-snapshot.png)\r\n\r\nLots of the basic interaction has been ported over from `prototype-007` as well.\r\nBut more importantly, the project and file structure are now well-organized and clean.\r\n\r\nI'm on schedule to have an alpha version of the game ready for _friendly_ testers near or shortly after the end of this week.\r\nAnd I'm pretty happy about that.\r\n\r\n#### Next up\r\n\r\n[The GitHub Kanban Board](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Forgs\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fprojects\u002F1\u002Fviews\u002F1) will show you:\r\nthe alpha release is super-minimal.\r\nOnly the very basics are in there, and I'll use a User Test Script of sorts that fills in the gaps.\r\n\r\nSo (near) laser-focus on that alpha-release, is what's up next!\r\n",{"id":34,"isDraft":7,"order":35,"date":36,"title":37,"content":38},"post-2023-03-14",5,["Date","2023-03-14T00:00:00.000Z"],"Day 30: Work In Progress","## Day 30: Work In Progress\r\n\r\n### **Jeroen**, March 14, 2023\r\n\r\n[Yesterday](#post-2023-03-13) I started the day with a devlog.\r\nIt outlined the goals and plan for this current stretch.\r\nSince the end of yesterday you can now publicly track progress [on the GitHub Kanban Board](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Forgs\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fprojects\u002F1\u002Fviews\u002F1).\r\n\r\nToday I'm building the foundations of the final codebase, using `prototype-007` as a reference point.\r\nWhich involves a ton of struggling with Godot's haphazard UI layout features.\r\nSo there's little time for an extended devlog.\r\nThese few paragraphs will have to do, dear reader!\r\n\r\nCatch you tomorrow!\r\nI'm off to get a wee bit more productivity out of today.\r\n",{"id":40,"isDraft":7,"order":41,"date":42,"title":43,"content":44},"post-2023-03-13",6,["Date","2023-03-13T00:00:00.000Z"],"Day 29: Planning","## Day 29: Planning\r\n\r\n### **Jeroen**, March 13, 2023\r\n\r\n\u003E But Jeroen, isn't halfway into the project a bit late to create a plan!?\r\n\r\nWhy yes, it would be!\r\nBut: I already _had_ a plan, just not fully written down.\r\nAnd now that the end of my mini-sabbatical is nearing, and the plan is becoming fuzzy, it's time to revise it.\r\n\r\nToday I'm writing a devlog _fully_ at the _start_ of the day.\r\nAs I write, I'll create a plan for the remainder of the project.\r\nAfter that, I'll commit the rest of the day to taking the first steps.\r\n\r\n#### Original plan\r\n\r\nSo, \"what was the 'original' not-written-down plan then?\", you may ask.\r\nWell, let's start with what I _did_ [write down at the start](#post-2023-02-16):\r\n\r\n[![early plans and brainstorm notes](\u002Fimg\u002Fv2023-02-14a-tipm-design-and-brainstorm.png)](\u002Fimg\u002Fv2023-02-14a-tipm-design-and-brainstorm.png)\r\n\r\nNote that the (respectively) pink and red highlighted items I considered most important.\r\nSo the plan was to:\r\n\r\n1. **Pick a name**, build a website + blog\r\n2. **Design and prototype** something, create primary sprites\r\n3. Set up something **temporary for sound and music**\r\n4. Create a **fun inner game loop**\r\n5. Learn the **game engine** needed for this\r\n6. Beta test it, **make sure it's _fun_** to play\r\n7. **Publish** and release to friends and family\r\n\r\nThe inner game loop would be:\r\n\r\n1. **Drag components around** to \"design\" a machine\r\n2. **Run the playbook** to see how it plays out\r\n\r\nThe secondary game loop:\r\n\r\n1. **Run the _inner_ game loop**\r\n2. **Check your score** and the medals you got\r\n3. **Unhappy**? Rinse and repeat. **Happy**? Go to next level.\r\n\r\nThe important thing is: **all of the above is still roughly relevant!**\r\nSo creating a fresh plan should be easy, right?!\r\n\r\n#### Goals\r\n\r\nBefore talking about a plan, I need to talk about _goals_.\r\nLet's start with the _initial_ goals.\r\nWhen asked before the start, I'd say something like this:\r\n\r\n\u003E I develop software for a living.\r\n\u003E But I've never developed a _game_ before.\r\n\u003E So I want to try that.\r\n\u003E\r\n\u003E The goal would be to create one small game, end to end, nearly every part of it created by myself.\r\n\u003E And earn at least one euro with it, which can also be my own 1 euro: I just want to see what it takes to getting to _publishing_ a game.\r\n\r\nIt's also interesting to now what I did _not_ declare to be my goals:\r\n\r\n- That it should be a _good_ game;\r\n- That it should be a _successful_ game (monetarily or otherwise);\r\n- That it should be _completely_ finished;\r\n\r\nIt's _very_ tough to _not_ care about those things.\r\nAnd to be honest: I _do_ care about all three (in the order above).\r\n\r\nBut those things were _not_ my goals at the start.\r\nAnd I think that has remained unchanged.\r\nSo the main goals remain:\r\n\r\n- Experience what it's like to _develop_ a game;\r\n- Publish _something_ and earn at least one euro with it;\r\n\r\nKnowing my (unchanged) goals, it's time to create a fresh plan.\r\n\r\n#### Revised plan\r\n\r\n[Prototype 007](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fprototype-007) after [Day 26](#post-2023-03-10) gives hope.\r\nIt should be good enough to help achieve above-stated goals.\r\nSo let's work from there.\r\nI should make it \"official\" too, and clean up a bit while doing so.\r\nThe first step should therefore be:\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 --\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003E 1. Move \"Prototype 007\" work over into the [core Pincrediball game repository](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fpincrediball).\r\n\u003E    Setting up a proper and clean project structure as I do so.\r\n\r\nAfter that I should basically have Prototype 007, but in a somewhat clean codebase.\r\nThe next steps would be to get to a playable state where I can ask friends to user test it.\r\nTo summarize:\r\n\r\n\u003E 2. Create a MUTeP: a Minimal User Testable Product.\r\n\u003E    Something that supports the _inner_ game loop.\r\n\u003E    Plus (possibly with workarounds) lets you imagine how the secondary game loop would work.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I just made the \"MUTeP\" acronym up.\r\n\r\nAfter getting test feedback, things shake up a bit.\r\nWho knows what testers will tell me?\r\nAnd what changes they require, affecting the plan.\r\nRegardless, the next step should be clear:\r\n\r\n\u003E 3. Handle feedback.\r\n\u003E    Fix the most glaring problems _that obstruct the end goals_.\r\n\u003E    Park all other suggestions and problems for the longer term.\r\n\r\nAfter this some extra feedback rounds may continue.\r\nBut looking at the main goals, the prime path to them has another focus.\r\nAt this point I should focus on making sure that _I myself_ am happy enough:\r\n\r\n\u003E 4. Make it publishable.\r\n\u003E    Make it good enough that I'm willing and happy (enough) to put it up on the web.\r\n\u003E    Including enough polish to make it presentable, without polishing forever.\r\n\r\nOriginally I thought I'd publish mainly (or even only) on Steam.\r\nBut I'm changing that a bit.\r\nI'm aiming to publish an alpha version with disclaimers on Itch.io first.\r\nAnd I'ld be happy with merely a wish-list page for Steam.\r\nIn short, the final step for during my mini-sabbatical would be:\r\n\r\n\u003E 5. Publish an early-access version.\r\n\u003E    Can be anywhere, as long as people can pay me an euro for it.\r\n\u003E    So that I might buy my own game, and accomplish the original goals.\r\n\r\nIt _feels_ possible to make these 5 steps in the remaining weeks.\r\nAnd it would feel great to do so, because I love the dopamine hit from achieving goals I set for myself.\r\n\r\nSo there you have it, that's the plan!\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- markdownlint-enable MD029 --\u003E\r\n\r\n#### Beyond the plan\r\n\r\nMy aim with the aforementioned plan is to achieve the initial goals.\r\nThere are goals _beyond_ those.\r\nThere's two layers of goals:\r\n\r\n1. _Complete_ the game and make it _good_ enough for my own tastes.\r\n   And then also publish it on Steam.\r\n\r\n2. Try to make it a _success_.\r\n   Which includes a ton of marketing and social media work.\r\n\r\n3. Go _beyond initial success_.\r\n   Dreaming big, there could be a version 2 of the game, which would be a proper version.\r\n   This could include a Kickstarter and\u002For trying to get extra help on the project.\r\n\r\nThese are in chronological order, but also in order of how likely they are to happen.\r\nThe first one is somewhat likely, as I already sunk the 100 euro's into Steam to be allowed to publish a game.\r\nBut even that goal I might skip.\r\n\r\nThe good news: I don't have to decide at the time of writing this.\r\nIn fact, **I need to stop writing and start building**.\r\nOtherwise I won't even be in a position to think about those extended plans.\r\n\r\nOff we go!\r\n\r\nPS.

Learn Godot's Drag & Drop system\r\n\u003E 2. Allow players to move at least _some_ components around\r\n\u003E 3. Learn about Scene Composition in Godot\r\n\u003E\r\n\u003E Plus: leave a little bit of energy to do some work on Saturday.\r\n\u003E I really need to make some plan for the last few weeks available to finish an alpha version.\r\n\r\nSo technically that's _four_ goals, I suppose?\r\nAlthough also technically I did parts of \"1\" already, as you can tell from [\u002Fresources#bookmarks--godot-game-engine](\u002Fresources#bookmarks--godot-game-engine).\r\n\r\nI will allow myself (at least) one more day to \"muddle around\" in [`prototype-007` code](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fprototype-007).\r\nAfter that I really should be thinking about a somewhat clean codebase for the target alpha release of the game.\r\n\r\nFor now, let me put down my writing hat, and take a few moments to work through those goals.\r\n\r\n_A few ~moments~ hours later..._\r\n\r\n#### Drag and Drop\r\n\r\nWhelp, that wasn't trivial.\r\nAnd as I feared when I just switched to Godot, them introducing a new major version would provide some hurdles.\r\nSo [a tiny underscore issue](https:\u002F\u002Fgamedev.stackexchange.com\u002Fquestions\u002F204808\u002Fdrag-and-drop-differences-between-godot-3-and-4) cost me a good two hours.\r\n\r\nBut, even though a little less

March 09, 2023\r\n\r\nDear reader: thank you!\r\n\r\nBecause if you're here, despite me not promoting this post, you must be a real fan!\r\n\r\n[Yesterday](#post-2023-03-08) led to some very tangible success.\r\nAs foreshadowed at the end of that post, today will be a shorter day.\r\nSo I was planning to spend some time on **research, instead of development**.\r\n\r\nMy plans include:\r\n\r\n- Structuring Research I've already done\r\n- Organizing my own glossary\r\n- Researching \"The Competition\" (other Pinball software and games)\r\n\r\nLet's get to the results, shall we!?\r\n\r\n#### Structuring Research\r\n\r\nI've already built up a long list of online resources I've used so far.\r\nHigh time to put this into a better, version controlled format!\r\n\r\nThe main part of my saved research consists of... **bookmarks**!\r\nLet's keep it simple for now, and just integrate the most interesting ones with this website.\r\nSo without any ado:\r\n\r\nFind them all at [pincrediball.com\u002Fresources#bookmarks](\u002Fresources#bookmarks)!\r\n\r\n#### Pinball Glossary\r\n\r\nIn my research I've found several glossaries for Pinball.\r\nNone of them summarize things in a way that suit me.\r\nSo it makes sense to create my own.\r\n\r\nSame holds here as for the \"Research\".\r\nIt makes the most sense (for now) to just add it to the website.\r\nSo, without any ado:\r\n\r\nFind the glossary at [pincrediball.com\u002Fresources#glossary](\u002Fresources#glossary)!\r\n\r\n#### Researching \"The Competition\"\r\n\r\nIf there _are_ any direct competitors, I might as well check them out.\r\nMost likely there _will_ be software to create (and possibly also play) Pinball machines, which I also want to check out.\r\nIf there's time I might check some more general Pinball games.\r\n\r\nThis item was _last_ in my list, for good reason.\r\nIt's super open-ended, and could take hours, but also days or weeks!\r\n\r\nIn fact, this goal I've missed for today.\r\nI'll put it into the (forthcoming) blog post on all sorts of random ideas I still have.\r\nBut for now: there's not much more to say.\r\n\r\n#### Summarizing\r\n\r\nRight.\r\nShort days are short.\r\nShorter even than you'd think.\r\nAnd I _really_ want to wrap up this post, _before_ I leave for social engagements.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'll revisit this post and the linked resources later in the day.\r\nBut most likely... _this will be it_.\r\nAnd tomorrow should be another day of actual _development_ work.\r\n\r\nUntil then!\r\n",{"id":67,"isDraft":7,"order":68,"date":69,"title":70,"content":71},"post-2023-03-08",10,["Date","2023-03-08T00:00:00.000Z"],"Day 24: Implementing the Tutorial Machine","## Day 24:

semi-competitor to my own game.\r\nEnough to get me past my original hesitation to research how (un)original my game idea is.\r\nAnd what I can _learn_ from those other games, of course.\r\n\r\nI really _must_ park that, if even for a day.\r\nAnd focus on the original goals.\r\nMore precisely specified, let me say out loud that today I aim to:\r\n\r\n1.

We're about to dive deep.\r\n\r\n#### 1. Designing the tutorial machine\r\n\r\nDesigning Pinball machines is a skill on its own.\r\nI have no such skill, but I've tried to do a base level of research.\r\nAmongst others, having checked [several PAPAPinball YouTube \"Machine Tutorials\"](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=XSw7fK6x1mw&list=PL-WQLGFMr97CQpOQDEvRqAiSqcvSuK11h&index=3)\r\nI see several aspects of a good Pinball machine:\r\n\r\n- **Theme** that's appealing (often tied to an existing brand, like \"Batman\" or \"Jurassic Park\");\r\n- **Backplate** with artwork around the theme;\r\n- **Quests**: hitting specific targets in specific orders, in a way that's also fun and challenging;\r\n- **Toys** are extra-special (often gimicky and theme-related) components of the machine that do something crazy when hit;\r\n- **Balance** between how hard goals are to hit (and how big a chance you have to drain the ball), and how many points they give;\r\n- [**Flipper tricks**](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=r_7TQ6wRZdw&list=PL-WQLGFMr97DnxeE1Rmi-wAwa-Vm7D-7i) should allow skilled players to be better at the game;\r\n- **Multi-ball** mode is usually a goal to work towards, preferably when **\"multipliers\"** are enabled;\r\n- **Basic components** that _must_ be included:\r\n  plunger (with plunger lane and a gate),\r\n  flippers,\r\n  balls,\r\n  lanes,\r\n  spinners,\r\n  bumpers,\r\n  drop targets,\r\n  slingshots,\r\n  and rollovers.\r\n- **Extra components** should probably also be included:\r\n  backbox and display,\r\n  outlanes,\r\n  ramps,\r\n  gates,\r\n  and kickbacks.\r\n- **Skill Shots** (plunging the initial ball at a particular speed to hit a particular target) are perfect for Pincrediball too.\r\n  Especially in the tutorial levels, the \"Playbook\" could contain a precise skill shot.\r\n  This makes it super fun to place the initial components in a very precise location.\r\n\r\nWe'll start with designing the theme, backplate, and quests.\r\nOne theme per \"stage\" of the game, so multiple levels are on the same theme.\r\nThe _Tutorial_ stage is up first.\r\nAlthough I don't have a good term or word for the theme yet, it'll revolve around:\r\n\r\n- Stick figures and a \"math\" paper background;\r\n- A limited color scheme with shades of blue, and some black and white;\r\n- Quests to build up a mini-comic lit up on the backplate;\r\n\r\nAt this point I'll stop writing out my thoughts on this blogpost.\r\nIt's time to grab a tool to design the initial art!\r\n\r\n_...a few ~moments~ hours later_:\r\n\r\n[![Pinball machine in progress](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-007-figma.png)](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-007-figma.png)\r\n\r\nThis gives me something to work with!\r\nInteresting notes about the design:\r\n\r\n- The plunger lane includes an amber-colored gate that should be \"one-way\" for the ball;\r\n- The three gates at the top are for points, and to be placed by the player in the game to create high scores;\r\n- There's a tiny start for stick-figure art in the main area, which will indicate quest progress;\r\n- I'm a noob at Figma, yet still made it work decently well!\r\n\r\nI want to continue tweaking this design, but I _must_ move on.\r\nThere's still two goals left for today.\r\nTime for a quick break, and then on to the next part.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Putting it into Godot\r\n\r\nFor some reason I figured that having SVG's in Figma would make it easy to import everything into Godot.\r\nI was half right.\r\nThe _wrong_ half.\r\n\r\nImporting the \"Art\" as textures was very easy.\r\n\r\nBut the important half was not so easy; perhaps more research is needed?\r\nI was hoping the SVG paths would be useful as collision shapes.\r\nEspecially the bezier curves seemed logical for a pinball machine.\r\nI set myself certain goals for today, and getting this bit perfect would hold me back.\r\n\r\nSo, I went the labor-intensive route.\r\nImporting the design of the machine in chunks from Figma.\r\nAnd after that... _manually tracing over those shapes again_, to create the collision polygons.\r\nSo...\r\n\r\n_...a few ~moments~ hours later_:\r\n\r\n[![Pinball machine in progress](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-007-godot.png)](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-007-godot.png)\r\n\r\nThat at least should work to some degree!\r\nLet's have a look, shall we?\r\n\r\n#### 3. Allow plunging a ball\r\n\r\nTime to program a little bit of interactivity.\r\nThe plan was as follows:\r\n\r\n- A \"Plunge\" button that spawns a ball and shoots it into the field;\r\n- **Bonus:** Flippers that just constantly, well, flipper;\r\n\r\nAfter a bunch of trial and error;\r\nafter a ton of Godot 3.x to 4.0 translation;\r\nafter loads of debugging and tweaking;\r\nin short after...\r\n\r\n_...a few ~momnets~ hours later_:\r\n\r\n\u003Cvideo controls loop\u003E\r\n  \u003Csource src=\"\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-007.mp4\" type=\"video\u002Fmp4\" \u002F\u003E\r\n  Video recording of a basic pinball machine and dozens of balls\r\n\u003C\u002Fvideo\u003E\r\n\r\nI have a ton of concerns still.\r\nMost notably if this will be deterministic enough for my core game idea.\r\nBut concerns be damned, **I'm pretty content with this result!**\r\n\r\n#### Recap\r\n\r\nIn short, I achieved what I set out to do:\r\n(1) design a machine, (2) put it in Godot, and (3) have basic ball physics.\r\nSetting the goals at the start certainly helped.\r\nTomorrow I might go for a more free-form day, but soon after I'll certainly use this same trick again.\r\n\r\nIf you made it this far into my stream-of-consciousness post:\r\nI salute you!\r\nYou're the best.\r\n\r\nOn to the next bits!\r\n",{"key":85,"posts":86},"2023, week 9",[87,93,99,105,111],{"id":88,"isDraft":7,"order":89,"date":90,"title":91,"content":92},"post-2023-03-03",13,["Date","2023-03-03T00:00:00.000Z"],"Day 19: Rest day","## Day 19: Rest day\r\n\r\n### **Jeroen**, March 03, 2023\r\n\r\nGot up an hour later than I wanted.\r\nEnjoyed a visit from a friend, preferred chatting over working on the project.\r\nSome spinning while watching Rick & Morty.\r\nAnd some LEGO Star War with the Mrs.\r\n\r\nIn short: not much game dev was done today.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I'll catch up over the weekend.\r\nOr maybe I'll just reboot next week.\r\nI'm fine with either, it's a _vacation_ project, after all.\r\nWe'll see!\r\n",{"id":94,"isDraft":7,"order":95,"date":96,"title":97,"content":98},"post-2023-03-02",14,["Date","2023-03-02T00:00:00.000Z"],"Day 18: Prototype 006 with Godot","## Day 18: Prototype 006 with Godot\r\n\r\n### **Jeroen**, March 02, 2023\r\n\r\nToday I followed advice from friends.\r\nGodot got several more recommendations.\r\nAnd right after I decided to take it for a spin, [Godot 4.0 was released](https:\u002F\u002Fgodotengine.org\u002Farticle\u002Fgodot-4-0-sets-sail\u002F).\r\n\r\n\u003E After 3+ years of breaking and rebuilding from the ground up, a complete core overhaul and a full engine rewrite: **Welcome to the start of Godot 4!**\r\n\r\nSo that's both good and bad.\r\nIt's nice that I join in right when a boost in new modern features is released.\r\n\r\nBut as I suspected, it's less nice that we're now in a state of limbo.\r\nDocumentation has warnings all over the place that they might still be out of date.\r\nOnline examples are thoroughly broken.\r\nAll forum posts and Q&A online still uses the 3.x way of things.\r\n\r\nBut if I download the 3.x LTS version, I'm learning obsolete skills from the get go.\r\nSo Godot 4.0 it was.\r\n\r\n#### Prototype?

_continue_ development.\r\nBut I feel like I reached a checkpoint _now_, so a recap is in order.\r\n\r\n#### Prototype 004\r\n\r\nLooking at the overview of posts you may wonder: \"What happened to prototype 004?\".\r\nGlad you asked!\r\nIn fact, on [Day 12](#post-2023-02-24) I combined Phaser with Svelte;\r\nonly at the end of that day did I \"promote\" it to [its own prototype repository](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Forgs\u002Fpincrediball\u002Frepositories?q=prototype).\r\nQuite likely `prototype-004` will even grow into the end result at some point.\r\n\r\n#### Ladies and Gentlemen: Prototype Number 005!\r\n\r\nSo, today I got up fresh and early.\r\nThe main problem to tackle: **some (more) determinism** in runs.\r\nOtherwise the core game loop (precisely placing parts so you get a high score) is no fun.\r\n\r\nDeterminism turns out to be quite difficult with MatterJS.\r\nBut that's only one problem.\r\nIt has no Continuous Collision Detection (CCD) either, causing the ball at high velocity to go _through_ walls.\r\nThis might get worse once I get to implementing flippers, I suspect.\r\nSo I was doubting my engine choice a bit.\r\n\r\nStill, after a productive morning, I found that things might be good enough for now.\r\nI tweaked the engine settings to a point where many parallel instances of my game would all give the same result.\r\nHere's [the \"proof\" of that](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fprototype-005):\r\n\r\n\u003Cvideo controls loop\u003E\r\n  \u003Csource

prototype made two things clear to me:\r\n\r\n- It gives enough _confidence_ to move forward with my current setup;\r\n- It causes enough _doubt_ that this engine should be the final choice for a _full_ game;\r\n\r\nIn short: a nice check point reached!\r\n\r\n#### What's next?\r\n\r\nSo the next steps are to go \"all in\" on the current approach.\r\nMore specifically, my to do list is currently:\r\n\r\n- Design a good looking tutorial theme and pinball machine;\r\n- Integrate that design, Prototype 004, and Prototype nr. 5;\r\n- Allow the player to move bumpers around\r\n- Add flippers to the game;\r\n\r\nPerhaps a few sound effects to make working on this project a bit more fun too.\r\nI will roll up the rest of today's work in the next devlog entry either way.\r\nStay tuned!\r\n",{"key":118,"posts":119},"2023, week

that it sparked joy to play around with something else.\r\nHere's what I changed up for this pincrediball.com's website source code.\r\n\r\n#### Prose TailwindCSS plugin\r\n\r\nTailwind resets styling, so you can reliably create Web Applications and Sites.\r\nThat's all great, but for long-form textual content it's actually painful to loose _all_ styling.\r\n[The Tailwind \"Prose\" plugin](https:\u002F\u002Ftailwindcss.com\u002Fdocs\u002Ftypography-plugin) aims to solve that, without compromising the reset of styles that Tailwind gives you.\r\n\r\nIt was just fine to write this devlog straight up with html and Tailwind classes.\r\nBut copy-pasting things like `mt-4` on each `\u003Cp\u003E` becomes tedious pretty quickly.\r\nThe Prose plugin fixes that nicely, and cleaned up my devlog source code considerably.\r\n\r\n#### Markdown for blogging\r\n\r\nThis also enables the next step.\r\nMarkdown is a far nicer format to write blogposts in.\r\nI had noticed before that [`svelte.dev` uses markdown for their blog](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fsveltejs\u002Fsites\u002Ftree\u002Fmaster\u002Fsites\u002Fsvelte.dev\u002Fcontent\u002Fblog),\r\nwhich sparked my interest.\r\n\r\nAfter briefly trying the (rather nice!) [svelte-exmarkdown](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fssssota\u002Fsvelte-exmarkdown) library, I decided I needed a bit more control.\r\nSo I dove a bit deeper into how `svelte.dev` does things.\r\nAnd that setup is quite nice indeed, as it includes support for SSR and RSS.\r\n\r\nSo, I used a (much) simplified variant of that setup.\r\nAnd: it works like a breeze!\r\nAdding a blog post can now be as simple as [adding one `.md` file to the repository](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball\u002Fpincrediball.com\u002Fcommit\u002F22f4cb509b4c4fbe3b81eb4089af522c21a14bb5)!\r\n\r\n#### What's next?\r\n\r\nThat's all nice!\r\nBut what's next?\r\nShould I ever feel like getting side-tracked again, there's a few things left to tweak:\r\n\r\n- RSS feed would be nice;\r\n- Having `[slug]` based pages might be nice;\r\n- GitHub Action to `npm run build` would be nice;\r\n- GitHub Action to deploy GH-Pages should be nice;\r\n\r\nBut for now: let's stop procrastination and get back to building the game.\r\nShall

about how I could wrangle the physics engine collisions into submission.\r\nAnd how much I should probably let go and embrace the chaos of a realistic engine.\r\n\r\nHowever, I still changed it up... for prototyping purposes!\r\n\r\nUsing PhaserJS and MatterJS might _still_ be the right way to go.\r\nBut I still wanted to try out how it feels to create a fully custom engine anyways.\r\n\r\nAnd while I was at that, I was also curious to see how far I can get with plain html, css, and JavaScript (and no _game_ engine).\r\nUsing SvelteKit and Tailwind, just for prototyping speed at the moment.\r\n\r\nI didn't get very far yet with writing the actual game loop and time ticker.\r\nBut I did do a bunch of good work on an initial game layout.\r\nIt's far from polished, but (even though polish might be 80% of the work?!) that's for later.\r\nHere's the initial results:\r\n\r\n[![Game in a browser

I go the PhaserJS route after all, I might be able to use this setup in conjunction with it.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm sorry to say: that's all for today, folks!\r\n\r\nAs a final footnote for today's devlog: I also decided to open source the prototypes.\r\nSo you can fully see me fumbling about.\r\nWriting all sorts of just-make-it-work code.\r\nYou can find [all the repositories in the Pincrediball GitHub organization](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fpincrediball).\r\nAnd for my most loyal readers (hi mum!), here's a quick peek at it, with just a random screenshot of me hacking about in prototype number three!\r\n\r\n[![VSCode showing prototype-003 files](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-003-part1b.png)](\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-003-part1b.png)\r\n\r\nPrototype 003 will

the project.\r\nAfter a week of \"meta\" stuff, designing, and a super-light prototype, today was spent on more in-depth prototyping.\r\n\r\nI'm very happy with what I _did_, but only moderately so with the _result_.\r\nHere, have a look for yourself first:\r\n\r\n\u003Cvideo controls loop\u003E\r\n  \u003Csource src=\"\u002Fimg\u002Fpincrediball-prototype-002.mp4\" type=\"video\u002Fmp4\"

prototypes.)\u003C\u002Fsmall\u003E\r\n\r\nLet's summarize what I learned during today's experiments, starting with the positives:\r\n\r\n- ✅ SvelteKit will be a great \"bearer\" of the game\r\n- ✅ Using plain html\u002Fcss\u002Fjs for parts of the app will likely turn out great\r\n- ✅ Tailwind enables for fast menu's and other UI\r\n- ✅ I got _something_ looking like Pinball physics to work\r\n\r\nHowever, I have many concerns after today:\r\n\r\n- ❌ MatterJS physics is wonky ls going _through_ static bounds or getting stuck)\r\n- ❌ Level editing is cumbersome in (vanilla) Phaser, without any tools\r\n- ❌ Curved shapes and SVG paths are a _major_ pain to use\r\n\r\nI'm not so sure yet where to go from here.\r\nHave I learned that I need to go back to my original idea?\r\nBuilding a super-simple physics engine of my own, to make everything far more deterministic and reliable?\r\nOr should I stick with out-of-the-box physics and just deal with the issues?\r\n\r\nPerhaps a night's sleep and some distraction will bring clarity.\r\n",{"key":151,"posts":152},"2023, week

**Jeroen**, February 16, 2023\r\n\r\nToday it's time to figure out an engine to use.\r\nI'm leaning heavily towards [PhaserJS](https:\u002F\u002Fphaser.io\u002F) (the main alternatives being Godot and Unity),\r\nbecause it allows me to tap into my existing web development and JavaScript skills.\r\n\r\nI'm mostly doing tutorials and reading documentation, so no exciting updates from today for the devlog.\r\nThat does give me a minute to share my rough \"plan\" I created earlier in the project.\r\nHere it is:\r\n\r\n[![Brainstorm overview divided in 6 sections: Design, Graphics\u002FArt,

became a rough \"plan\".\r\nEach of the six parts is roughly a timebox of one week.\r\nI'm starting with \"Design\" this week, but currently borrowing a bit from the next goal: \"Game Loop \u002F Engine\".\r\n\r\nStuff's color coded too: the red stuff is Must-Haves, yellow Should-Haves, and green the Nice-to-Haves.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\nToo optimistic?\r\nProbably.\r\nBut let's see how far we'll get, shall we?!\r\n",{"id":166,"isDraft":7,"order":167,"date":168,"title":169,"content":170},"post-2023-02-15",25,["Date","2023-02-15T00:00:00.000Z"],"Day 3: Website first?","## Day 3: Website first?\r\n\r\n### **Jeroen**, February 15, 2023\r\n\r\nContinuing from day 2 with a focus on _fun_ activities, I decided to finish up the website.\r\nThis time I don't think I can claim anymore that it's in the end somehow part of the _critical path_ though?\r\n\r\nBut regardless of whether it was _The Right Thing_ to do right now, it _was_ very effective!\r\nI mean: you're looking at the very result right now.\r\n\r\nThe website was built with SvelteKit and TailwindCSS, which was rather efficient because I recently used it for both of my other recent side-projects:\r\n[Tierdom](https:\u002F\u002Ftierdom.jeroenheijmans.nl) and [vesta.infi.nl](https:\u002F\u002Fvesta.infi.nl).\r\nBut not before I spent the entire morning learning some more Figma skills to do the entire design first.\r\n\r\nI only bought the domain name, used\r\n[GitHub pages with a custom and apex domain](https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.github.com\u002Fen\u002Fpages\u002Fconfiguring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site\u002Fabout-custom-domains-and-github-pages#using-an-apex-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)\r\nfor hosting the whole thing.\r\nWhich, after the usual DNS hassle, works quite well!\r\n\r\nAll this means three important things:\r\n\r\n- I can _comfortably share_ the plans with the world\r\n- I am _on schedule_ for week 1's plans\r\n- I have _no excuses left_ to procrastinate prototyping\r\n\r\nSo let's end this third day with some initial social media posts and links to this website.\r\n\r\n**And tomorrow: we prototype!**\r\n",{"id":172,"isDraft":7,"order":173,"date":174,"title":175,"content":176},"post-2023-02-14",26,["Date","2023-02-14T00:00:00.000Z"],"Day 2: Now we're getting

high was by _doing essential things disguised as non-essential things_.\r\nBy this I mean I tried to incorporate essential things (work on the designs and game idea) into far less essential things (that were enjoyable to do).\r\n\r\nFirst thing I did was to **redo the main game screen's design**.\r\nFor fun I've shared that on the (current, at the time of writing) [home page](\u002F).\r\nAfter that I took care of a bunch of other non-essential (but fun!) things:\r\n\r\n- ✅ Logo &amp; Banner designed\r\n- ✅ YouTube channel claimed\r\n- ✅ Itch.io account claimed\r\n- ✅ Socials set up\r\n- ✅

toot](https:\u002F\u002Fmastodon.social\u002F@jeroenheijmans\u002F109865321998439644).\r\nAnd it really gave me a bunch of inspiration and energy to continue
