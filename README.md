# Pincrediball.com Website source

This is the source code for the [Pincrediball.com](https://pincrediball.com) website.

## About the game

Pincrediball is "The Automata Pinball Wizard game!".
The website source is probably not what you're after, instead I recommend checking [Pincrediball.com](https://pincrediball.com) itself!

## About the source

This is a SvelteKit project, to be hosted using GitHub pages.

### Development

Just run `npm run dev` in combination with vscode and a browser.

### Production build

Running `npm run build` will generate the static website in `/docs` which is served by GitHub pages on a custom domain.

## License

The code is open, but proprietary for the moment.
