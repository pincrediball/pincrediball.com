## Day 43: Home stretch! (Part 1 of 5)

**_Jeroen_, March 27, 2023**

Got up at 07:00 for some spinning and Last of Us, followed by a quick shower.
At 08:00 I was ready for the first day of the final project week.
A good start surely leads to a good day?

### Coming together

And a good day it was!
Things are coming together quite nicely, and today I added plenty of small and big features:

- ✔ Saving and loading the player's Progress
- ✔ Saving and loading Options
- ✔ Progress overview improvements
- ✔ Revamped and improved toolbox
- ✔ Navigating the various stages (still called "levels" at the moment)
- ✔ Animations to help with navigation
- ✔ Less score disabling, now only when needed
- ✔ Drag & Drop improvements
- ✔ Better descriptions for toolbox items
- ✔ Medal update improvements
- ✔ Extra sounds

And in general **level progression is now working**.
Which means **you can now actually _finish_ a playthrough**.
I do still need to add a celebration screen for that, amongst other things.

Here's the current state of things:

Several of the above mentioned features in action right there.
Showcase of the animations will have to wait, because today was a long day.
I _will_ showcase one extra still though:

This are the scores my primary beta tester (thank you, dear! <3) in her first full playthrough!
One for the books.

### Four days left

So that is one day down, four to go this week.
Tomorrow we'll round out something that's "releasable".
That should leave three days to actually release some thing, and round up otherwise.

Who knows!?
Maybe I'll have a spare day of vacation left on Friday?

...

Nah, who am I kidding?
I'll probably just add more features, content, or polish.

Onwards!
