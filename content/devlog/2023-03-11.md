## Day 27: Weekend thoughts

### **Jeroen**, March 11, 2023

Wait what's up!?
A _weekend_ devlog?
That's a first!

Let me explain.

Week 10 started with an [XXL post on Day 22](#post-2023-03-06).
I set three strict goals to achieve for the day.
But I tend to get distracted by random ideas.
Things to procrastinate with.
So I decided to write them down in a little notepad.

But a random file somewhere is no great solution.
So on [Day 23](#post-2023-03-07) I decided to stash them into this blog post.
That means the bulk of all ideas were written down during this week.
All ready to go in markdown format.

#### Where to leave them?

First I figured I'd just finish this blog post with a giant list of ideas.
But now that it's time to finish the post, I realize: **ideas change, we _iterate_ on them**.
So something less "permanent" or "captured in time" is needed.

I'm a fan of keeping things in once place as much as possible.
It's also nice to do things out in the open a lot, because it feels like commitments then.
And since they're markdown already anyways: **let's stash them into (GitHub) issues**.

Heck, I might even give GitHub's "projects" feature another go.
Who knows?

#### What are side-tracks do we have?

So I don't like making this blog post a permanent exhaustive list of ideas.
But what I _can_ do is to show off what I'm starting with.
The content is in the git history of this post's markdown anyways.

So, here's the current list of ideas.
They're only the titles now, each linking to where to find them on GitHub:

- **Ideas for Pincrediball.com**
  - [Change header levels while transforming markdown](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball.com/issues/1)
  - [Improve Table of Contents (from markdown) generation](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball.com/issues/2)
  - [Glossary in visual format](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball.com/issues/3)
  - [Fix spelling mistakes in old blog posts](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball.com/issues/4)
  - [Add VS Code extension recommendations to repository](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball.com/issues/5)
  - [Generate individual blog-post pages](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball.com/issues/6)
- **Game meta stuff**
  - [Create initial Steam Store page](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball/issues/1)
  - [Create or reserve initial Itch.io page](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball/issues/2)
  - [Add some initial YouTube content](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball/issues/3)
  - [Research other relevant Pinball software and games](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball/issues/4)

And that's all the temptations for procrastination I'd written down so far.

#### Which core ideas are there?

Thoughts and plans for the game itself reside in my head still.
We can't link to a GitHub issue then, but we can summarize it in one single to-do:

- **Project planning**.
  Really, I need to set goals (or accept I'll continue without any).
  Create some sort of plan or road map, if I feel like it.

The [labels in GitHub](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball/labels) have been prepared.
So week 5 of development should just start with this to-do.

#### Anything else?

And there's the ideas that are neither procrastination-worthy (at this moment), nor core to the game.
They don't deserve a GitHub issue (yet).
So let me just dump them here, so they might not haunt my progress.

- **Kickstarter**.
  Even though I'm skeptical about if or when I'm going to finish Pincrediball, I still like to dream big.
  If there's a playable alpha version, it might even be possible to create a Kickstarter.
  Even if only to see how that works.
- **Chase SvelteHack organizers**.
  Emailed the organizers of [hack.sveltesociety.dev](https://hack.sveltesociety.dev/) a while ago.
  I'm really curious if my pincrediball.com site would qualify, since light work on it was started just before the official announcement.
  Would be good to send another e-mail or something similar, as I haven't had _any_ response at all.
- **Devlog graphs**.
  I think it would be cool to show a couple of line graphs, detailing aspects of development.
  Per day a rating for things like "happiness", "productivity", "success", or possibly others.
  And now that things are still fresh, I could fill it in for the past few weeks.
  Then again... this idea is a bit "out there", and not relevant at all to actually building the damn game...

And that's really it.
Now my head is empty.
No more core ideas, procrastination sidetracks, or out-there thoughts left.

In short: I'm ready for week 5!
Bring it.
