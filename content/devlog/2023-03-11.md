## (DRAFT) Day 27: Design day

### **Jeroen**, March 11, 2023

Wait what's up!?
A _weekend_ devlog?
That's a first!

Let me explain.

Week 10 started with an [XXL post on Day 22](#post-2023-03-06).
I set three strict goals to achieve for the day.
But I still get distracted by other ideas.
Things to procrastinate with.
So I needed a solution for that.

I already started a markdown-formatted list of ideas and to-do's on that day.
But I had no great way to keep those notes.
So on [Day 23](#post-2023-03-07) I decided to stash them into this blogpost.
That means the weekend blogpost has been written mostly during the rest of the week.

I'm not sure yet if I'll keep the list of ideas below in my blogpost.
Most likely I'll reorganize that in the weekend or thereabouts.
Maybe GitHub issues will be a decent place for these things?
Who knows.
For now I need a dumping ground.

#### Parked ideas and to-do's

So here's a big list of ideas that came up recently:

- **Ideas for Pincrediball.com**
  I have several ideas to improve this website as well, including:
  - **Dynamic header levels in Markdown**.
    The blog posts _should_ have a `h1` level title.
    This way if I ever create individual blog post pages they'll neatly get a `h1`.
    And for `/devlog` where all posts sit on one page, they can be dynamically changed.
    (The markdown plugin allows for overriding the header rendering methods.)
  - **Improve headers setup**.
    Additionally, the headers need tweaking.
    First, the author + date line doesn't need to be a header.
    It can be just an emphasized paragraph.
    That way all subsequent headers can be bumped one level.
    Which makes more sense and is thus good for accessibility.
    Additionally, the `prose` styles will turn out nicer.
  - **Bookmark organization**.
    All my researched bookmarks are in one big dumping folder.
    At the least I should organize them so I can find stuff more easily.
    In addition it might be fun to move the interesting ones straight onto the website.
  - **Terminology infographic**.
    It was hard to find a good visual aid for all Pinball terms.
    Creating one myself would be fun and useful.
- **YouTube uploads**.
  It might be fun to turn some of the prototype videos into some initial content for the YouTube channel?
  Might be better than a completely empty space, also to avoid Google from nullifying the channel.
  (The videos would need some kind of background music though, or else it's _too_ boring.)
- **Chase SvelteHack organizers**.
  Emailed the organizers of [hack.sveltesociety.dev](https://hack.sveltesociety.dev/) a while ago.
  Asked if my projects would qualify, since some light work was done _before_ the official start date.
  Never got a reply, so might be nice to chase that?
  (Although if I go with Godot, the game might be less integrated with the website than what'd be nice for the hackathon.)
- **Reorganize project planning**
  To make sure I get where I want during my vacation, I need to create a planning.
  Set project goals, etc.
  Some things that require thought around this include:
  - **Steam Store Page + Wishlisting**
    If I truly want to aim for releasing something, it would be good to set up a store page rather early.
    So wishlists can grow.
    Heck, perhaps enough traction is even required before Steam is _willing_ to sell my game?
    Anyways, creating a good (enough) Store Page is a fun to do anyways.

All those ideas needed to be parked in favor of the three main goals.
