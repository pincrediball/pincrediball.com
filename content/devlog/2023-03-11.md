## Day 27: Weekend Chores

### **Jeroen**, March 11, 2023

Wait what's up!?
A _weekend_ devlog?
That's a first!

Let me explain.

Week 10 started with an [XXL post on Day 22](#post-2023-03-06).
I set three strict goals to achieve for the day.
But I tend to get distracted by random ideas.
Things to procrastinate with.
So I decided to write them down in a little notepad.

But a random file somewhere is no great solution.
So on [Day 23](#post-2023-03-07) I decided to stash them into this blog post.
That means the bulk of all ideas were written down during this week.
All ready to go in markdown format.

#### Where to leave them?

First I figured I'd just finish this blog post with a giant list of ideas.
But now that it's time to finish the post, I realize: **ideas change, we _iterate_ on them**.
So something less "permanent" or "captured in time" is needed.

I'm a fan of keeping things in once place as much as possible.
It's also nice to do things out in the open a lot, because it feels like commitments then.
And since they're markdown already anyways: **let's stash them into (GitHub) issues**.

Heck, I might even give GitHub's "projects" feature another go.
Who knows?

#### What are we starting with?

So I don't like making this blog post a permanent exhaustive list of ideas.
But what I _can_ do is to show off what I'm starting with.
The content is in the git history of this post's markdown anyways.

So, here's the current list of ideas.
Let me start with leaving them in the git history right here:

- **Ideas for Pincrediball.com**
  I have several ideas to improve this website as well, including:
  - **Dynamic header levels in Markdown**.
    The blog posts _should_ have a `h1` level title.
    This way if I ever create individual blog post pages they'll neatly get a `h1`.
    And for `/devlog` where all posts sit on one page, they can be dynamically changed.
    (The markdown plugin allows for overriding the header rendering methods.)
  - **Improve headers setup**.
    Additionally, the headers need tweaking.
    First, the author + date line doesn't need to be a header.
    It can be just an emphasized paragraph.
    That way all subsequent headers can be bumped one level.
    Which makes more sense and is thus good for accessibility.
    Additionally, the `prose` styles will turn out nicer.
  - **Table of Content generation with Marked.js**.
    The `/resources` page has a manual table of contents.
    You need to keep it in synch with the markdown files yourself.
    Surely we can extend Marked to generate such a table of contents yourself?
    Research note: [Marked is singleton by default](https://github.com/markedjs/marked/issues/907) so that may require some work.
  - **Bookmark organization**.
    All my researched bookmarks are in one big dumping folder.
    At the least I should organize them so I can find stuff more easily.
    In addition it might be fun to move the interesting ones straight onto the website.
  - **Terminology infographic**.
    It was hard to find a good visual aid for all Pinball terms.
    Creating one myself would be fun and useful.
  - **Fix spelling mistakes**.
    On day 24 I decided to install a spelling check VSCode addon.
    It won't hurt to go back through old posts to see what I've missed.
  - **Recommended addons**.
    Adding vscode recommended extensions in the repository seems helpful (e.g. if I'd ever edit stuff on another machine).
- **YouTube uploads**.
  It might be fun to turn some of the prototype videos into some initial content for the YouTube channel?
  Might be better than a completely empty space, also to avoid Google from nullifying the channel.
  (The videos would need some kind of background music though, or else it's _too_ boring.)
- **Chase SvelteHack organizers**.
  Emailed the organizers of [hack.sveltesociety.dev](https://hack.sveltesociety.dev/) a while ago.
  Asked if my projects would qualify, since some light work was done _before_ the official start date.
  Never got a reply, so might be nice to chase that?
  (Although if I go with Godot, the game might be less integrated with the website than what'd be nice for the hackathon.)
- **Reorganize project planning**.
  To make sure I get where I want during my vacation, I need to create a planning.
  Set project goals, etc.
  Some things that require thought around this include:
  - **Steam Store Page + Wishlisting**.
    If I truly want to aim for releasing something, it would be good to set up a store page rather early.
    So wishlists can grow.
    Heck, perhaps enough traction is even required before Steam is _willing_ to sell my game?
    Anyways, creating a good (enough) Store Page is a fun to do anyways.
- **Research other Pinball Software and Games**.
  There are plenty of other Pinball games.
  More interestingly, there might be games with the same or a similar concept as Pincrediball.
  At the least there is bound to be software to "design your own pinball machine" (and possibly play it).
  Research into the most relevant ones seems useful!
  It will also be nice to add them to `/resources`.

All those ideas needed to be parked in favor of the three main goals.

#### And now what?

Great!
We stuffed all the ideas in one or two central places!
The next step is simple:

**I have to make a _plan_**

My mini-sabbatical ends in 3 weeks.
Given how far I've come in the past 4 weeks, I need to think hard on goals and estimates.
Set some realistic and fun milestones... or accept to go on without any.

But that's for the upcoming week!
See you then.
