## Day 1: Gotta start somewhere!

**_Jeroen_, February 13, 2023**

First day of the week I decided to start the project.
However, the night before we watched the Super Bowl... in the GMT+1 timezone!
So was up until 04:30 (that's AM for y'all), naturally this wasn't the most productive day.

But the most important thing got done: I got _started_ on the project!
Plus several important things got done nonetheless, as [I wrote on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jeroenheijmans/109859902264743330):

- ✅ Brainstorm done
- ✅ Rough plan created
- ✅ Name chosen
- ✅ Domain bought!
- ✅ GitHub org and repo's claimed
- ✅ Social media names claimed
- ✅ Game loop basics designed
- ✅ Initial designs

In the end would call day 1 a success!
