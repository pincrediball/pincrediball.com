## Day 23: Design day

### **Jeroen**, March 07, 2023

[Yesterday](#post-2023-03-06) was an "XXL" day.
Finished very late as well.
So today I'll go a little easier.

#### First half of a blogpost

Here's the goal for today:

1. Design a "finished" tutorial machine.

That's it.
Just one goal for today.
I'm starting by writing this first half of the blogpost.
To gather thoughts and set my goals.
Because that part did work well, yesterday.

Here's my thoughts on switching back to "Designing" for a bit.
**First up**, I _enjoyed_ doing the designs.
So it's easy to stay motivated this way.

**Second**, it will _fixate scope_ for the Pinball Machine components of the Tutorial stage.
So it should help me keep things small (enough).
And free up some mental space, once those things are "on paper".

**Third**, and most importantly:
it should help me _flesh out the core game concepts_.
The Tutorial machine should "proof" that the game loops are _fun_.
Or it will _disproof_ that, and allow me to pivot if needed.

So, without further ado, let me get to creating those designs...
