## Day 23: Designing the Tutorial Machine

**_Jeroen_, March 07, 2023**

[Yesterday](#post-2023-03-06) was an "XXL" day.
Finished very late as well.
So today I'll go a little easier.

### First half of a blog post

Here's the goal for today:

1. Design a "finished" tutorial machine.

That's it.
Just one goal for today.
I'm starting by writing this first half of the blog post.
To gather thoughts and set my goals.
Because that part did work well, yesterday.

Here's my thoughts on switching back to "Designing" for a bit.
**First up**, I _enjoyed_ doing the designs.
So it's easy to stay motivated this way.

**Second**, it will _fixate scope_ for the Pinball Machine components of the Tutorial stage.
So it should help me keep things small (enough).
And free up some mental space, once those things are "on paper".

**Third**, and most importantly:
it should help me _flesh out the core game concepts_.
The Tutorial machine should "proof" that the game loops are _fun_.
Or it will _disproof_ that, and allow me to pivot if needed.

So, without further ado, let me get to creating those designs...

### Second half of a blog post

We're at the end of the day, and there's _some_ result.
Not entirely happy yet, but "good enough" for now.

Decided to "work backwards" with level design.
First I designed _one configuration_ of the tutorial stage that finishes the last level with at least bronze.
Here's the completed machine, as it's built up from the ground:

Outer bounds and background artwork will always be visible to the player.
Components can be placed nearly anywhere on the field.
The artwork is supposed to be a guided tutorial for where things could have a nice placement.

Quests (if ever) can be added to the tutorial by just completing the various goals a set number of time.
The center artwork could just light up more firmly for each achieved goal.
And perhaps increase the multiplier for scores by doing so?

Next day(s) I will try to move all these components into Godot.
Programming their features as I go along.
At some point the entire pinball machine should be "done".
I guess if I add keybindings for the flippers I will have made a basic flipper game?

After that I'm planning to add the actual core features:
players can move around components, then run playbooks to achieve high scores.
I'm sure to run into design troubles at that stage.

But for now, this result will have to do!

### Summarizing

A limited goal for the day, and that worked out just fine!
Moderately happy with this result, even though I guess all I did was "_design a mediocre Pinball Machine_".
Curious to see if I can _at least_ turn that into a _working_ "mediocre Pinball game"...
