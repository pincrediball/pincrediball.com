## Day 8: Prototype 002

**_Jeroen_, February 20, 2023**

After not doing too much during the weekend (days 6 & 7), it's now Monday of week 2 and high time to get back to the project.
After a week of "meta" stuff, designing, and a super-light prototype, today was spent on more in-depth prototyping.

I'm very happy with what I _did_, but only moderately so with the _result_.
Here, have a look for yourself first:

Let's summarize what I learned during today's experiments, starting with the positives:

- ✅ SvelteKit will be a great "bearer" of the game
- ✅ Using plain html/css/js for parts of the app will likely turn out great
- ✅ Tailwind enables for fast menu's and other UI
- ✅ I got _something_ looking like Pinball physics to work

However, I have many concerns after today:

- ❌ MatterJS physics is wonky ls going _through_ static bounds or getting stuck
- ❌ Level editing is cumbersome in (vanilla) Phaser, without any tools
- ❌ Curved shapes and SVG paths are a _major_ pain to use

I'm not so sure yet where to go from here.
Have I learned that I need to go back to my original idea?
Building a super-simple physics engine of my own, to make everything far more deterministic and reliable?
Or should I stick with out-of-the-box physics and just deal with the issues?

Perhaps a night's sleep and some distraction will bring clarity.
