## Day 38: Productive Procrastination

**_Jeroen_, March 22, 2023**

I needed a _"win"_ today.
So I took a break from Drag & Drop, hoping for a break in Godot gotchas as well.
Time for some "**Productive Procrastination**"!

### Splash screen

I finalized the splash screen.
Not much to say or show about this.
But it does round out the game as a real _game_.

### Menu

Although not even strictly necessary, I wanted to further "round out" Pincrediball with a proper menu.
So I built one today.
Let's enjoy the results before we "enjoy" the struggles:

Building this felt like I was teleported back to 1998.
That's when I was doing web layouts with tables.
We were building rounded corners on things with 3x3 tables and a background image tailored to each cell.

_Anno 2023_ Godot even has [a dedicated control](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_ninepatchrect.html) for this.
Now that remark's a bit of a cheap shot, but even the _intended_ controls are an absolute _pain_.
For sure a pain to _learn_, and so far also a pain to _use_.

So I gave up.
And just created some pixel-perfect buttons in Figma, once for each state.
And used a `TextureButton`.
Cop out?
Maybe.
Satisfying?
Hell yes!

### Credits

The pinnacle of productive procrastination must be to create Credits for an unfinished game.
So that's what I did!
A tiny sneak peak (for full credits you'll need to play the actual game!):

Did I use all the tricks and hacks I had up my sleeve?
Maybe.
Am I proud of that?
Also maybe.

### Alpha release?

My [goals](#day-29-planning--goals) haven't changed.
The plan _has_, a little.
Today I let my partner try out the very first build of Pincrediball to leave my machine.
So technically the "alpha" release has been done and tested.
And it gave plenty of good feedback!

With that shortcut taken I can chug along towards the goals while sacrificing a little bit of quality.
Today an intermezzo was on the menu.
Tomorrow we're having the next course: more Godot (gotchas), until we have a fully playable game!
