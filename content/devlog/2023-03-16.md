## Day 32: Alpha Release nearby

**_Jeroen_, March 16, 2023**

We're steadily approaching a state where I'm ready to let some initial testers handle it.
This version of the game will be equivalent to what you get at the end of a "Design Sprint".
It requires a test script and an interviewer (to explain what's _not_ finished and testable yet).
But still: a milestone!

Here's what currently happens when you play the game:

Notably the **drag and drop features are missing** so you can't actually _play_ the game yet.
That will be [the main issue](https://github.com/orgs/pincrediball/projects/1/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=22796854) to tackle tomorrow!
With some further tweaks to some components, physics, and _maybe_ placeholder sound effects, we should close in on the alpha release.
Nice!

Now excuse me while I run off to play some Lego Star Wars or Cascadia, and recharge for the last day of this week tomorrow.
