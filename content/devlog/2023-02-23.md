## Day 11: Sidetracked with Markdown

**_Jeroen_, February 23, 2023**

I let myself get sidetracked...

Not sure how much it is to procrastinate working on the actual game.
But I _am_ sure that it sparked joy to play around with something else.
Here's what I changed up for this pincrediball.com's website source code.

### Prose TailwindCSS plugin

Tailwind resets styling, so you can reliably create Web Applications and Sites.
That's all great, but for long-form textual content it's actually painful to loose _all_ styling.
[The Tailwind "Prose" plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) aims to solve that, without compromising the reset of styles that Tailwind gives you.

It was just fine to write this devlog straight up with html and Tailwind classes.
But copy-pasting things like `mt-4` on each `<p>` becomes tedious pretty quickly.
The Prose plugin fixes that nicely, and cleaned up my devlog source code considerably.

### Markdown for blogging

This also enables the next step.
Markdown is a far nicer format to write blogposts in.
I had noticed before that [`svelte.dev` uses markdown for their blog](https://github.com/sveltejs/sites/tree/master/sites/svelte.dev/content/blog),
which sparked my interest.

After briefly trying the (rather nice!) [svelte-exmarkdown](https://github.com/ssssota/svelte-exmarkdown) library, I decided I needed a bit more control.
So I dove a bit deeper into how `svelte.dev` does things.
And that setup is quite nice indeed, as it includes support for SSR and RSS.

So, I used a (much) simplified variant of that setup.
And: it works like a breeze!
Adding a blog post can now be as simple as [adding one `.md` file to the repository](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball.com/commit/22f4cb509b4c4fbe3b81eb4089af522c21a14bb5)!

### What's next?

That's all nice!
But what's next?
Should I ever feel like getting side-tracked again, there's a few things left to tweak:

- RSS feed would be nice;
- Having `[slug]` based pages might be nice;
- GitHub Action to `npm run build` would be nice;
- GitHub Action to deploy GH-Pages should be nice;

But for now: let's stop procrastination and get back to building the game.
Shall we?
