## Day 24: Implementing the Tutorial Machine

### **Jeroen**, March 08, 2023

A strong contender for procrastination of today's original goals came up.
From a friend I got a link to an old semi-competitor to my own game.
Enough to get me past my original hesitation to research how (un)original my game idea is.
And what I can _learn_ from those other games, of course.

I really _must_ park that, if even for a day.
And focus on the original goals.
More precisely specified, let me say out loud that today I aim to:

1. Get at least _Sprites_ in my game for all Tutorial elements;
2. Get behavior in for round bumpers;
3. Stretch goal: get behavior in for slings;

I'm gonna "state my goals publicly" again.
This time I'll do so by pushing relevant commits to GitHub early.
I could use the method I introduced earlier ([with "(DRAFT)" in the title](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball.com/commit/2d1051a9ab69d92104472ea5e7469d9fd2c3a89b#diff-49d919cc2693b0e3ba9a5cca314294b09fde3e8a1787c4f57a7c658b61fc5092)),
but today I'll just go with the simpler "not yet running `npm run build` yet".

At this point it is time to get coding!

#### Results!

So, here's how far we've gotten:
