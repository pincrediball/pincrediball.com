## Day 15: Prototype 005

**_Jeroen_, February 27, 2023**

First day of week 3 of the project, day 15 of the project.

I'm writing an early devlog today.
After writing this I will probably _continue_ development.
But I feel like I reached a checkpoint _now_, so a recap is in order.

### Prototype 004

Looking at the overview of posts you may wonder: "What happened to prototype 004?".
Glad you asked!
In fact, on [Day 12](#post-2023-02-24) I combined Phaser with Svelte;
only at the end of that day did I "promote" it to [its own prototype repository](https://github.com/orgs/pincrediball/repositories?q=prototype).
Quite likely `prototype-004` will even grow into the end result at some point.

### Ladies and Gentlemen: Prototype Number 005!

So, today I got up fresh and early.
The main problem to tackle: **some (more) determinism** in runs.
Otherwise the core game loop (precisely placing parts so you get a high score) is no fun.

Determinism turns out to be quite difficult with MatterJS.
But that's only one problem.
It has no Continuous Collision Detection (CCD) either, causing the ball at high velocity to go _through_ walls.
This might get worse once I get to implementing flippers, I suspect.
So I was doubting my engine choice a bit.

Still, after a productive morning, I found that things might be good enough for now.
I tweaked the engine settings to a point where many parallel instances of my game would all give the same result.
Here's [the "proof" of that](https://github.com/pincrediball/prototype-005):

This prototype made two things clear to me:

- It gives enough _confidence_ to move forward with my current setup;
- It causes enough _doubt_ that this engine should be the final choice for a _full_ game;

In short: a nice check point reached!

### What's next?

So the next steps are to go "all in" on the current approach.
More specifically, my to do list is currently:

- Design a good looking tutorial theme and pinball machine;
- Integrate that design, Prototype 004, and Prototype nr. 5;
- Allow the player to move bumpers around
- Add flippers to the game;

Perhaps a few sound effects to make working on this project a bit more fun too.
I will roll up the rest of today's work in the next devlog entry either way.
Stay tuned!
