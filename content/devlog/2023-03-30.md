## Day 46: Home stretch! ("Final to-do's")

**_Jeroen_, March 30, 2023**

Let's recap the project goal one last time:

> The goal would be to create one small game, end to end, nearly every part of it created by myself.
> And earn at least one euro with it, which can also be my own 1 euro:
> I just want to see what it takes to getting to publishing a game.

Today, I reached that milestone!

Mind you, I paid myself that $1 _after_ I successfully completed a playthrough in the browser.
Here is the html5 version of the game running on itch:

The game store page _is_ still in draft and not publicly available.
But I _could_ make it public right now and call it good.

So, what's holding me back?
Well, about 25 different things.
Here's the subset I _really_ hope to fix on the last day of the project.

### Plan for The Final Day

#### Apple devices

MacOS, iOS, and iPadOS all fail to load or crash the html5 version of the game.
Regardless of the browser used.
I'm not even sure if this is fixable, because I've already spotted several Godot GitHub issues around this subject
([\#67949](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/67949), [\#70691](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/70691), and others).

It would be fantastic to have a desktop build for macOS as an alternative.
However, it's not trivial to build and sign apps for macOS when you don't have an Apple device around.
Plus it's also not easy to test then.

So, **at the very least** I then need to post a very good warning on the itch page.
Which is doable enough, even though it's a bit sad.

#### Last-minute game changes

There's two important things I really want to add:

- some extra introductory hints
- a final polish of the physics variables

This can also easily become a time sink, especially the second one.
Perhaps I should save it for last?
Either way, it's doable to do _something_ here.

#### Steam Store Page

There's a _ton_ of things to fill out for Steam.
I've made a start, but there's just so many details to fill out.
And even then Steam suggests it'll take days to process and review things.

So this one seems less doable, unfortunately.
Which is sad, but not a showstopper.

#### Screenshots and Trailer

A store page isn't much without some good content.
Screenshots should be easy to make.
A trailer can easily become a time sink, despite having a bunch of (hobbyist level) video editing experience

Probably I should just start with something, anything really, that's good enough.
That's doable too then, I reckon.

#### Publish the itch.io page

The _final_ thing to do will be to publish it and making it publicly available.
Nice to have would be to add a Desktop build for Windows and Linux (see above why I'm leaving out macOS for the moment).

I will start with a "soft launch", by only announcing it on the devlog and to friends and via socials.
Any feedback or other final polish I might apply after my sabbatical.
Just to have a slightly better "real Demo launch", which I'd hope to share a little broader (though my reach is not huge).

#### Release devlog

Okay, an even _more final_ thing would be to write a final devlog to celebrate the "soft launch".
Friday's post should serve as a little bit of closure, given that my day job starts again on Monday as well.

### And beyond?

"What lies beyond?", you'd ask?
Well, there's a bunch of ideas.
I will only do the bare minimum to (feel good about it and) announce the game a little bit more broadly.
After that I need a good long break from (this) game('s) development.

If by some miracle (which I hardly expect) the game racks up a bunch of "wish listings", I might actually complete a full game.
But more likely reviews will be "Mixed" at best, and low in quantity.
And that's totally fine too!
Because I enjoyed this sabbatical project a ton.
And that's what counts the most.

But first, let's get ready for a Final Day in this "Home stretch!".
Until tomorrow!
