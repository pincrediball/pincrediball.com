## Day 31: Mixed feelings

### **Jeroen**, March 15, 2023

I feel good about today's progress.
And I feel pretty salty about today's progress.
Mixed feelings, I'd say.

#### Salty

Building the foundations for the final app I encountered a super weird bug.
The ball would sometimes just jump off on its own.
And sometimes it would "sink" into a platform.

Here's what it the bug looks like (with some slow motion):

After _hours_ of reading documentation, bisecting code, and debugging, I found the issue:
**the texts and white rectangle to the _left_ of the machine can _sometimes_ cause the ball inside the machine to jump about**.
Absolutely nuts!

So I felt pretty unhappy about lost time.
But Annoyance made room for feeling relieved when I found a good minimal way to reproduce it.

Yet I was soon back to being even more salty again.
Here's how.
I wrote [a good reproducible scenario](https://github.com/jeroenheijmans/repro-godot-bounce-bug) and [GitHub issue for Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/74940)
A super short summary of the repro:

- Create a specific (valid!) Node Tree
- The tree involves combining GUI and Node2D nodes with physics
- The presence of a white rectangle (!) next to the physics node, can affect if the physics _inside_ that node in weird ways

However, I was informed in a one-sentence reply:

> I think this is not a bug, but **user error**.

Ahh, the good old "_stupid user_" excuse.
Because the wording straight up _blames_ the user for their problems.
_They_ are in error.
This probably makes me extra salty because I've used that excuse myself in the past.
And I'm now ashamed I used to do so.

Another user is slightly more friendly, but still also says:

> [This is not on] the engine [..., only] a **wrong expectation** [by you].

With a bit of empathy, the same meaning for both replies could be conveyed in a much friendlier way.
Plus I _still_ think that it's reasonable to expect either the Editor or the Documentation to somehow help users avoid this pitfall.
Especially since behavior _inside_ a component was erratically affected by its siblings.

The second commenter ended with a bonus suggestion too:

> I recommend joining one of the communities to get feedback and support when looking for a solution and ending up with something that is not working.

Guess that's a pretty strong hint that I should not be investing in any further interaction with Godot's GitHub community...

#### Happy

Even through that loss of several hours, I still made some good progress!
So there's also reasons to be happy.
Above animated gif already showed it, here's also a still image of the current state of the game:

Lots of the basic interaction has been ported over from `prototype-007` as well.
But more importantly, the project and file structure are now well-organized and clean.

I'm on schedule to have an alpha version of the game ready for _friendly_ testers near or shortly after the end of this week.
And I'm pretty happy about that.

#### Next up

[The GitHub Kanban Board](https://github.com/orgs/pincrediball/projects/1/views/1) will show you:
the alpha release is super-minimal.
Only the very basics are in there, and I'll use a User Test Script of sorts that fills in the gaps.

So (near) laser-focus on that alpha-release, is what's up next!
