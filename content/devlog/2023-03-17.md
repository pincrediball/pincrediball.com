## Day 33: Sound's good?

### **Jeroen**, March 17, 2023

Although there's plenty of visual changes, today it's worth viewing progress with sound turned on (I muted it by default):

Are these the best sound effects and bits of background music in the world?
No.
But it's _something_ and that's where we've got to start!

Some other changes, next to music and sound:

- The "Playbook" top left is now "real" and connected;
- The "Run Playbook" button will reset score and flippers;
- The "Your Score" part has been better aligned with "Score Targets";
- Basics for level medals and level progression are in place.

#### Alpha release then?

So one notable thing is _still_ missing: [Drag & Drop](https://github.com/orgs/pincrediball/projects/1/views/1).
Which actually is the core of the inner game loop.
Together with a few other bits it's the last thing missing for the alpha release.
Here's a snapshot of [the Kanban Board](https://github.com/orgs/pincrediball/projects/1/views/1):

I'm a bit sad that I didn't fully finish the alpha release this week.
If I'd pushed a bit harder this week, or would work a bunch over the weekend, I'd be able to finish it.

But I won't.
It's a hobby- and vacation project.
It's meant to be fun.
And there's plenty of time left.
So I'm off for the weekend, and will continue on Monday where I left off.

See you then!?
