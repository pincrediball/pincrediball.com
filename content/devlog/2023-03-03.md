## Day 19: Rest day

**_Jeroen_, March 03, 2023**

Got up an hour later than I wanted.
Enjoyed a visit from a friend, preferred chatting over working on the project.
Some spinning while watching Rick & Morty.
And some LEGO Star War with the Mrs.

In short: not much game dev was done today.

Perhaps I'll catch up over the weekend.
Or maybe I'll just reboot next week.
I'm fine with either, it's a _vacation_ project, after all.
We'll see!
