## Day 37: Dropping the beat!

**_Jeroen_, March 21, 2023**

Yesterday I did the first bits of drag action.
Today dropping stuff in the right places has been implemented.
There's a _metric_ ton of things left to smooth out, but let's start with the good parts.
Here's what you can currently do:

_Super_ clunky, but you might get the basic idea?

### Checklist

So we achieved quite a bit today:

- ✔ Dragging "new" components from the toolbox on the left to the playing field
- ✔ Dragging "existing" components on the playfield around
- ✔ Crude animation (green flashing area) of the valid drop area
- ✔ Fallback for when trying to drop outside the valid area

In addition to some other unrelated improvements:

- ✔ Music and SFX toggle buttons
- ✔ Run Playbook option will now reset the balls
- ✔ Official "Stress Test" option to fire off 10 balls
- ✔ Score reset when running playbooks
- ✔ Score disabled during a "Stress Test"

But there's a ton left that's not (yet) working surrounding Drag & Drop functionality:

- ❌ Rotating certain components (bumper pills and wall corners) is missing
- ❌ Toolbox items should be usable only the allotted number of times, not infinitely
- ❌ You should _not_ be able to move items during a play run
- ❌ Each Playbook should get a maximum number of seconds of runtime
- ❌ A "Stop Playbook" option is needed
- ❌ The "Toolbox" looks ugly and cramped, the layout needs work

And given the late hour when I write this probably a few more things.

### Kowalski, analysis!

The situation is... ~grim~ ~dire~ ~ugly~ ~promising~... frustrating?
Godot and game development are a struggle (for a web developer by trade).
Around every corner there's a new gotcha waiting, it seems.
Perhaps my expectation of picking it up quickly given software development skills in other areas was unrealistic?

Either way I'm proud to be pressing on.
And proudly press on, I shall!
The quality might not be where I want it to be, but my [goals](#post-2023-03-13) I _will_ reach!

Onward.
