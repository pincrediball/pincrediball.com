## Day 9: Prototype 003, part 1

### **Jeroen**, February 21, 2023

After [yesterday](#post-2023-02-20) several friends helped out with some rubber duck debugging.
Got some great input on Slack and in other places about how I could wrangle the physics engine collisions into submission.
And how much I should probably let go and embrace the chaos of a realistic engine.

However, I still changed it up... for prototyping purposes!

Using PhaserJS and MatterJS might _still_ be the right way to go.
But I still wanted to try out how it feels to create a fully custom engine anyways.

And while I was at that, I was also curious to see how far I can get with plain html, css, and JavaScript (and no _game_ engine).
Using SvelteKit and Tailwind, just for prototyping speed at the moment.

I didn't get very far yet with writing the actual game loop and time ticker.
But I did do a bunch of good work on an initial game layout.
It's far from polished, but (even though polish might be 80% of the work?!) that's for later.
Here's the initial results:

Obviously, this still needs work.
But it's getting somewhere.
Even if I go the PhaserJS route after all, I might be able to use this setup in conjunction with it.

And I'm sorry to say: that's all for today, folks!

As a final footnote for today's devlog: I also decided to open source the prototypes.
So you can fully see me fumbling about.
Writing all sorts of just-make-it-work code.
You can find [all the repositories in the Pincrediball GitHub organization](https://github.com/pincrediball).
And for my most loyal readers (hi mum!), here's a quick peek at it, with just a random screenshot of me hacking about in prototype number three!

Prototype 003 will likely get some more love the coming days.
Stay tuned!
