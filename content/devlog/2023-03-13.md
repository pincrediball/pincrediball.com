## Day 29: Planning

### **Jeroen**, March 13, 2023

> But Jeroen, isn't halfway into the project a bit late to create a plan!?

Why yes, it would be!
But: I already _had_ a plan, just not fully written down.
And now that the end of my mini-sabbatical is nearing, and the plan is becoming fuzzy, it's time to revise it.

Today I'm writing a devlog _fully_ at the _start_ of the day.
As I write, I'll create a plan for the remainder of the project.
After that, I'll commit the rest of the day to taking the first steps.

#### Original plan

So, "what was the 'original' not-written-down plan then?", you may ask.
Well, let's start with what I _did_ [write down at the start](#post-2023-02-16):

[![early plans and brainstorm notes](/img/v2023-02-14a-tipm-design-and-brainstorm.png)](/img/v2023-02-14a-tipm-design-and-brainstorm.png)

Note that the (respectively) pink and red highlighted items I considered most important.
So the plan was to:

1. **Pick a name**, build a website + blog
2. **Design and prototype** something, create primary sprites
3. Set up something **temporary for sound and music**
4. Create a **fun inner game loop**
5. Learn the **game engine** needed for this
6. Beta test it, **make sure it's _fun_** to play
7. **Publish** and release to friends and family

The inner game loop would be:

1. **Drag components around** to "design" a machine
2. **Run the playbook** to see how it plays out

The secondary game loop:

1. **Run the _inner_ game loop**
2. **Check your score** and the medals you got
3. **Unhappy**? Rinse and repeat. **Happy**? Go to next level.

The important thing is: **all of the above is still roughly relevant!**
So creating a fresh plan should be easy, right?!

#### Goals

Before talking about a plan, I need to talk about _goals_.
Let's start with the _initial_ goals.
When asked before the start, I'd say something like this:

> I develop software for a living.
> But I've never developed a _game_ before.
> So I want to try that.
>
> The goal would be to create one small game, end to end, nearly every part of it created by myself.
> And earn at least one euro with it, which can also be my own 1 euro: I just want to see what it takes to getting to _publishing_ a game.

It's also interesting to now what I did _not_ declare to be my goals:

- That it should be a _good_ game;
- That it should be a _successful_ game (monetarily or otherwise);
- That it should be _completely_ finished;

It's _very_ tough to _not_ care about those things.
And to be honest: I _do_ care about all three (in the order above).

But those things were _not_ my goals at the start.
And I think that has remained unchanged.
So the main goals remain:

- Experience what it's like to _develop_ a game;
- Publish _something_ and earn at least one euro with it;

Knowing my (unchanged) goals, it's time to create a fresh plan.

#### Revised plan
