## Day 29: Planning

### **Jeroen**, March 13, 2023

> But Jeroen, isn't halfway into the project a bit late to create a plan!?

Why yes, it would be!
But: I already _had_ a plan, just not fully written down.
And now that the end of my mini-sabbatical is nearing, and the plan is becoming fuzzy, it's time to revise it.

Today I'm writing a devlog _fully_ at the _start_ of the day.
As I write, I'll create a plan for the remainder of the project.
After that, I'll commit the rest of the day to taking the first steps.

#### Original plan

So, "what was the 'original' not-written-down plan then?", you may ask.
Well, let's start with what I _did_ [write down at the start](#post-2023-02-16):

[![early plans and brainstorm notes](/img/v2023-02-14a-tipm-design-and-brainstorm.png)](/img/v2023-02-14a-tipm-design-and-brainstorm.png)

Note that the (respectively) pink and red highlighted items I considered most important.
So the plan was to:

1. **Pick a name**, build a website + blog
2. **Design and prototype** something, create primary sprites
3. Set up something **temporary for sound and music**
4. Create a **fun inner game loop**
5. Learn the **game engine** needed for this
6. Beta test it, **make sure it's _fun_** to play
7. **Publish** and release to friends and family

The inner game loop would be:

1. **Drag components around** to "design" a machine
2. **Run the playbook** to see how it plays out

The secondary game loop:

1. **Run the _inner_ game loop**
2. **Check your score** and the medals you got
3. **Unhappy**? Rinse and repeat. **Happy**? Go to next level.

The important thing is: **all of the above is still roughly relevant!**
So creating a fresh plan should be easy, right?!

#### Revised plan
