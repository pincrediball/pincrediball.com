## Day 29: Planning

### **Jeroen**, March 13, 2023

> But Jeroen, isn't halfway into the project a bit late to create a plan!?

Why yes, it would be!
But: I already _had_ a plan, just not fully written down.
And now that the end of my mini-sabbatical is nearing, and the plan is becoming fuzzy, it's time to revise it.

Today I'm writing a devlog _fully_ at the _start_ of the day.
As I write, I'll create a plan for the remainder of the project.
After that, I'll commit the rest of the day to taking the first steps.

#### Original plan

So, "what was the 'original' not-written-down plan then?", you may ask.
Well, let's start with what I _did_ [write down at the start](#post-2023-02-16):

[![early plans and brainstorm notes](/img/v2023-02-14a-tipm-design-and-brainstorm.png)](/img/v2023-02-14a-tipm-design-and-brainstorm.png)

Note that the (respectively) pink and red highlighted items I considered most important.
So the plan was to:

1. **Pick a name**, build a website + blog
2. **Design and prototype** something, create primary sprites
3. Set up something **temporary for sound and music**
4. Create a **fun inner game loop**
5. Learn the **game engine** needed for this
6. Beta test it, **make sure it's _fun_** to play
7. **Publish** and release to friends and family

The inner game loop would be:

1. **Drag components around** to "design" a machine
2. **Run the playbook** to see how it plays out

The secondary game loop:

1. **Run the _inner_ game loop**
2. **Check your score** and the medals you got
3. **Unhappy**? Rinse and repeat. **Happy**? Go to next level.

The important thing is: **all of the above is still roughly relevant!**
So creating a fresh plan should be easy, right?!

#### Goals

Before talking about a plan, I need to talk about _goals_.
Let's start with the _initial_ goals.
When asked before the start, I'd say something like this:

> I develop software for a living.
> But I've never developed a _game_ before.
> So I want to try that.
>
> The goal would be to create one small game, end to end, nearly every part of it created by myself.
> And earn at least one euro with it, which can also be my own 1 euro: I just want to see what it takes to getting to _publishing_ a game.

It's also interesting to now what I did _not_ declare to be my goals:

- That it should be a _good_ game;
- That it should be a _successful_ game (monetarily or otherwise);
- That it should be _completely_ finished;

It's _very_ tough to _not_ care about those things.
And to be honest: I _do_ care about all three (in the order above).

But those things were _not_ my goals at the start.
And I think that has remained unchanged.
So the main goals remain:

- Experience what it's like to _develop_ a game;
- Publish _something_ and earn at least one euro with it;

Knowing my (unchanged) goals, it's time to create a fresh plan.

#### Revised plan

[Prototype 007](https://github.com/pincrediball/prototype-007) after [Day 26](#post-2023-03-10) gives hope.
It should be good enough to help achieve above-stated goals.
So let's work from there.
I should make it "official" too, and clean up a bit while doing so.
The first step should therefore be:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 -->

> 1. Move "Prototype 007" work over into the [core Pincrediball game repository](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball).
>    Setting up a proper and clean project structure as I do so.

After that I should basically have Prototype 007, but in a somewhat clean codebase.
The next steps would be to get to a playable state where I can ask friends to user test it.
To summarize:

> 2. Create a MUTeP: a Minimal User Testable Product.
>    Something that supports the _inner_ game loop.
>    Plus (possibly with workarounds) lets you imagine how the secondary game loop would work.

And yes, I just made the "MUTeP" acronym up.

After getting test feedback, things shake up a bit.
Who knows what testers will tell me?
And what changes they require, affecting the plan.
Regardless, the next step should be clear:

> 3. Handle feedback.
>    Fix the most glaring problems _that obstruct the end goals_.
>    Park all other suggestions and problems for the longer term.

After this some extra feedback rounds may continue.
But looking at the main goals, the prime path to them has another focus.
At this point I should focus on making sure that _I myself_ am happy enough:

> 4. Make it publishable.
>    Make it good enough that I'm willing and happy (enough) to put it up on the web.
>    Including enough polish to make it presentable, without polishing forever.

Originally I thought I'd publish mainly (or even only) on Steam.
But I'm changing that a bit.
I'm aiming to publish an alpha version with disclaimers on Itch.io first.
And I'ld be happy with merely a wish-list page for Steam.
In short, the final step for during my mini-sabbatical would be:

> 5. Publish an early-access version.
>    Can be anywhere, as long as people can pay me an euro for it.
>    So that I might buy my own game, and accomplish the original goals.

It _feels_ possible to make these 5 steps in the remaining weeks.
And it would feel great to do so, because I love the dopamine hit from achieving goals I set for myself.

So there you have it, that's the plan!

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD029 -->

#### Beyond the plan

My aim with the aforementioned plan is to achieve the initial goals.
There are goals _beyond_ those.
There's two layers of goals:

1. _Complete_ the game and make it _good_ enough for my own tastes.
   And then also publish it on Steam.

2. Try to make it a _success_.
   Which includes a ton of marketing and social media work.

3. Go _beyond initial success_.
   Dreaming big, there could be a version 2 of the game, which would be a proper version.
   This could include a Kickstarter and/or trying to get extra help on the project.

These are in chronological order, but also in order of how likely they are to happen.
The first one is somewhat likely, as I already sunk the 100 euro's into Steam to be allowed to publish a game.
But even that goal I might skip.

The good news: I don't have to decide at the time of writing this.
In fact, **I need to stop writing and start building**.
Otherwise I won't even be in a position to think about those extended plans.

Off we go!
