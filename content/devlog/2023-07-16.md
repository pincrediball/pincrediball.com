## Day 106: Game Development Sucks; Developing Games Rocks!

**_Jeroen_, July 16, 2023**

I am a web- and mobile app developer by trade.
During an eight week sabbatical I built "Pincrediball".
**I loved developing a game**, but **I _hated_ game development**.

Allow me to explain.
But first...

### Welcome new readers!

Long-time readers can skip this section, but if you're new here: welcome!
The short of it is that I built a game for the first time, in 8 weeks time.
And you can find it here:

- [Pincrediball on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2378150/Pincrediball) (Early Access, free, all Operating Systems)
- [Pincrediball on Itch.io](https://pincrediball.itch.io/pincrediball) (free, but you can tip; browser based)
- [Pincrediball on GitHub](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball) (the full source code!)

To get a quick feeling for what this game is about, watch the release trailer:

I'm quite proud I managed to design, build, publish, and actually _finish_ the whole thing.
I also enjoyed most of the road to get here.
Why is it then that I say I "hate" game development?

### About "Hating Game Development"

Again: **I _loved_ developing a game**.
It's just that **I hated game development**.
There's a subtle but important difference between the two.
My own guess is that the reason has to with the fact that:

- I _did_ have a **lot of _web_ development** experience.
- I had **zero _game_ development** experience to speak of;

This is an extremely nasty combination, or so I presume.
It puts me top-right in the following table, extended with my take on the other three possibilities:

|                                 | Little WEB Dev Experience                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Lots of WEB Dev Experience                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **Little GAME Dev Experience**  | 🤩 **Game Dev is perfect for you!** Most tutorials in Game Development are aimed at your skill level. You'll be amazed at how fast you'll be able to build stuff. And the "elbow grease" needed to get a game completed will feel totally normal. You won't miss any of the stuff that I felt was lacking. | 😭 **This was _my_ corner**. Nearly none of the tools and techniques you know and love from creating web API's or front-ends will be available. You'll be struggling to find game dev information on proper CI/CD, automated testing, inversion of control, or tooling and architecture in general. |
| **Lots of GAME Dev Experience** | 🧙‍♂️ **You're likely a wizard!** You've honed your skill and learned tricks from the industry. Or you may work for a big(ger) studio with in-house tooling to compensate for the lack of industry-wide public knowledge. My blogpost might seem weirdly incorrect or besides-the-point.                      | 🦄 **You're the one I need(ed)!** You can tell me why this devlog is wrong, tell me that there _are_ tools that I just wasn't able to find. Bridge the gap between the wonderful things from Web Development and their equivalents in Game Development.                                             |

In terms of [the psychological "Four stages of competence"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence)
(related to the Dunning-Kruger effect) I feel like I am **"Consciously Incompetent"** as far as Game Development is concerned.
Because I'm still incompetent, I might very well be wrong.
But I'd claim:

> Game Development seriously lacks broadly available proper practices and tooling.

Here are come examples of what I found lacking:

- **Continuous Integration and Deployment** knowledge and tooling is nearly non-existent.
- **Automated testing** is hardly talked about.
- **Flow of Data** seems to be an afterthought, there's nearly nothing to be found about Unidirectional Data Flow or similar patterns.
- **Architecture and Best Practices** are seemingly left to each individual developer, with only adhoc advice here and there.
- **Et cetera...** See the [Day 42 blog post](#post-2023-03-26) for more details and extra examples.

Now consider .NET Core, Laravel, SvelteKit, NextJS, or a dozen other web development frameworks.
Each of those has amazing and extensive documentation and great starter templates, to create robust and future proof code.
Comparing that to the PhaserJS and Godot situation, I found things seriously lacking.
I hear similar stories from friends and colleagues working with Unity or Unreal Engine.

Mind you, there is _some_ information on the above topics.
And I appreciate the creators of that content all the more!
But relative to web development eco-systems, information is either hard to find or nonexistent.
Especially if you're just starting out.

### About the Godot engine

The above section spoke in broad terms about Game Development.
I purposely generalized from my experience with Godot (and PhaserJS).
And that feels warranted.
Based on conversations with folks who did their first work in Unity or Unreal, I reckon it's roughly the same deal there.

There are a few specific things to say about Godot though.

However, it's weird to "complain" about a free and Open Source tool.
So let me start by saying that **I'm very grateful for the hard work put into Godot**.
I even [put my money where my mouth was](#post-2023-03-28).
And overall it was actually a pretty decent experience to build something in Godot.

Having said that, if you're a web developer (like me) coming to game development: be warned!
There are several things with Godot that you'll likely also find awkward:

- [**Inheritance is favored over composition**](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/about/faq.html#does-godot-use-an-ecs-entity-component-system)
- [**Godot rolled their own flavor of Python**](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/about/faq.html#what-were-the-motivations-behind-creating-gdscript)
- **UI building is powerful but verbose**, and frustrating compared to doing HTML and CSS.
- **Debugging is hard**, and you'll miss the tools you have in web development.
- **Open Source interactions can be harsh**, at least for the core Godot stuff.

This is in addition to the general Game Development gripes I mentioned earlier.

Overall however, I think **Godot is _great_ for developing your first game**.
If you're aware of the gotchas, there are also many things to like about Godot.
It's easy to pick up, and has a good visual editor.
You can compile for several platforms, and the tool is free and open source.
[The documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/) is quite good and comprehensive.

And the proof is in the end result: **it enabled me to build a full game in a few weeks**!
So let's talk a little bit about that "proof", shall we?

### Source code

If you're a Web Developer going into Game Development with Godot,
you might also find [the Pincrediball Source](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball) a useful resource.
Disclaimer: I am by no means a Godot expert.
However, I did try to create as clean and robust code as I could with the tools available.

If you're going to look through the code, I particularly would recommend looking at:

- My poor-man's implementation of **Unidirectional Data Flow** (e.g. in [the Scoring "store"](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball/blob/main/src/game/core/scoring.gd).
  It has to rely on the singleton pattern, public functions for actions, and events instead of selectors.
  But it gets the job done: things are highly cohesive but not tightly coupled.
  It prevents a ton of data being passed around and events bubbling through the inheritance tree.
- Being forced by Godot to rely on inheritance over composition,
  I still manage to apply some **Inversion of Control** (e.g. in [the Base Pinball Component](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball/blob/main/src/game/tutorial/component_base.gd)).
- The code follows [the official Style Guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html) closely
  and would pass **Linting Tools**... if there would've been any.
- The general [**Folder Structure**](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball/tree/main/src)
  has been carefully chosen, despite the lack of good guidance available online.
  It should work well for small and medium sized games; it won't hold up for larger projects though.

But I also recommend you only take this as inspiration, and a way to "not feel alone" as a web developer in the Godot world.
Do not take it as a set of best practices or recommendations... remember:
**I am consciously incompetent**.

### Further reading

Perhaps this post got you interested, and you'd like to cherry pick some further reading.
For that case I'll share my **Top 5 Pincrediball Devlog Posts**, the most interesting ones for the general public:

1. [Day 45: Statistics](#post-2023-03-29): effort needed to do a project like this.
2. [Day 44: Giving back](#post-2023-03-28): some love for the tools I used.
3. [Day 24: Tutorial Machine](#post-2023-03-08): promising results halfway through are great!
4. [Day 17: Giving up](#post-2023-03-01): the inevitable solo game development "crash".
5. [Day 01: Gotta start somewhere](#post-2023-02-13): just look at how little is needed to get started!

But of course if you feel like it you can also scan or read through the entire devlog since [day 1](#post-2023-02-13).

### Final words

Time for some closing remarks about Game Development, and about the project.

I'm happy I took a stab at game development.
I'm proud that I finished an entire game, and got it published on Itch.io _and_ on Steam.
It was fun, and I'll likely do something similar again!

And to fully close of, I'll just repeat the post title:

> **Game development sucks. But developing games rocks!**
