## Day 106: Game Development Sucks; Developing Games Rocks!

**_Jeroen_, July 16, 2023**

I am a web- and mobile app developer by trade.
During an eight week sabbatical I built "Pincrediball".
I loved developing a game, and also **I _hated_ game development**.

Allow me to explain.
But first...

### Welcome new readers!

Long-time readers can skip this section, but if you're new here: welcome!
This section is for you.
The TLDR is that I built game for the first time, in 8 weeks time.
And you can find it here:

- [Pincrediball on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2378150/Pincrediball) (Early Acess, free, all Operating Systems)
- [Pincrediball on Itch.io](https://pincrediball.itch.io/pincrediball) (free, but you can tip; browser based)
- [Pincrediball on GitHub](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball) (the full source code!)

Also useful to get a feeling for what Pincrediball is... the release trailer:

I'm very proud at having come this far.
I enjoyed most of the road to get here.
Why is it then that I say I "hate" game development?

### About "Hating Game Development"

First things first: **I _loved_ developing a game**.
It's just that **I hated game development**.
There's a subtle but important difference between the two.
My own guess is that the reason has to with the fact that:

- I _do_ have a **_lot_ of web development** experience.
- I have only **_little_ game development** experience;

This is an extremely nasty combination, or so I presume.
It puts me top-right in the following table, extended with my take on the other three possibilities:

|                                 | Little WEB Dev Experience                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Lots of WEB Dev Experience                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| **Little GAME Dev Experience**  | 🤩 **Game Dev is perfect for you!** Most tutorials in Game Development are aimed at your skill level. You'll be amazed at how fast you'll be able to build stuff. And the "elbow grease" needed to get a game completed will feel totally normal. You won't miss any of the stuff that I felt was lacking. | 😭 **This was _my_ corner**. Nearly none of the tools and techniques you know and love from creating back-ends or front-ends will be available. You'll be struggling to find information on proper CI/CD, automated testing, inversion of control, or tooling and architecture in general. |
| **Lots of GAME Dev Experience** | 🧙‍♂️ **You're likely a wizard!** You've honed your skill and learned tricks from the industry. Or you may work for a big(ger) studio with in-house tooling to compensate for the lack of industry-wide knowledge. My blogpost might seem weirdly incorrect or besides-the-point.                             | 🦄 **You're the one I need(ed)!** You can tell me why this devlog is wrong, tell me that there _are_ tools that I just wasn't able to find. Bridge the gap between the wonderful things from Web Development and their equivalents in Game Development.                                    |

In terms of [the psychological "Four stages of competence"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence)
(related to the Dunning-Kruger effect) I feel like I am **"Consciously Incompetent"** as far as Game Development is concerned.
Because I'm still incompetent, I might very well be wrong.
But I'd claim:

> Game Development seriously lacks broadly available proper practices and tooling.

Here are come examples of what I found lacking.
Continuous Integration and Deployment knowledge and tooling is nearly non-existent.
Automated testing is hardly talked about.
There's very little high quality knowledge or documentation about how Data flows through apps.
And in general it's very hard to find best practices around architecture and all things related.

Put differently, consider .NET Core, Laravel, SvelteKit, NextJS, or a dozen other web development frameworks.
Each of those has amazing and extensive documentation and great starter templates, to create robust and future proof code.
Comparing that to the PhaserJS and Godot situation, I found things seriously lacking.
I hear similar stories from friends and colleagues working with Unity or Unreal Engine.

But!
**Do not let this deter you from developing a game**, which is fun even when game development is... disappointing at times.

And if you're keen on doing so, you may find some value in my experience.
So let me close off with a few more positive notes about my experience.

### Favorite devlogs

Since I already wrote what I wanted to share, I can just link to previous work.
Starting with my own suggested **Top 5 Pincrediball Devlog Posts** for those interested.
They are:

1. [Day 45: Statistics](#post-2023-03-29): effort needed to do a project like this.
2. [Day 44: Giving back](#post-2023-03-28): some love for the tools I used.
3. [Day 24: Tutorial Machine](#post-2023-03-08): promising results halfway through are great!
4. [Day 17: Giving up](#post-2023-03-01): the inevitable solo game development "crash".
5. [Day 01: Gotta start somewhere](#post-2023-02-13): just look at how little is needed to get started!

But of course if you feel like it you can also scan or read through the entire devlog since day 1.

### Source code

If you're a Web Developer going into Game Development with Godot, you might also find [the Pincrediball Source](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball) a useful resource.
Disclaimer: I am by no means a Godot expert.
However, I did try to create as clean and robust code as I could with the tools available.

If you're going to look through the code, I particularly would recommend looking at:

- My poor-man's implementation of **Unidirectional Data Flow** (e.g. in [the Scoring "store"](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball/blob/main/src/game/core/scoring.gd).
  It has to rely on the singleton pattern, public functions for actions, and events instead of selectors.
  But it gets the job done: things are highly cohesive but not tightly coupled.
  It prevents a ton of data being passed around and events bubbling through the inheritance tree.
- Being forced by Godot to rely on inheritance over composition,
  I still manage to apply some **Inversion of Control** (e.g. in [the Base Pinball Component](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball/blob/main/src/game/tutorial/component_base.gd)).
- The code style, which follows [the official Style Guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html) closely
  and would pass **Linting Tools**... if there would've been any.
- The general [**Folder Structure**](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball/tree/main/src) for which there is no real guidance in the Godot ecosystem.
  I spent quite a bit of time finding something half-decent.
  It will _not_ hold up for very large games.
  But should work for small and medium sized ones.

But I also recommend you only take this as inspiration, and a way to "not feel alone" as a web developer in the Godot world.
Do not take it as a set of best practices or recommendations... remember:
**I am consciously incompetent**.

### Final words

I'm happy I took a stab at game development.
I'm proud that I finished an entire game, and got it published on Steam.
It was fun, and I'll likely do something similar again!

But my final words on this devlog can only be a repeat of this post's title...

**Game development sucks. But developing games rocks!**
