## Day 42: Weekend Bonus (XXL devlog)

**_Jeroen_, March 26, 2023**

It's awesome when people _read_ my posts online.
But most of my _motivation_ comes from the _writing_ itself.
Writing posts will:

- Help me cement and remember learnings;
- Straighten out my thoughts;
- Make plans or brainstorm ideas;
- Let me vent a little when needed;

The fact that people _might_ read my posts helps me aim for some level of quality.
The fact that my motivation comes from within in turn helps restrain the perfectionism.

Today's "bonus" post is about the first bullet.
It's about cementing learnings about game dev tricks I didn't know about before.
In no particular order, it's a list of techniques that have (at first sight!) no big cross-over to web development (or do they!?).

**âš ** As such, it's a rather lengthy post! I won't blame you for sitting this one out.

### Game Development Specifics

First, let's start with things largely _specific_ to game development.

#### Shaders

When playing AAA games a loading screen might call out "_Pre-processing shaders_" or something similar.
So I knew there was something called "shaders".
But since this week I know what they actually are.
And how to make (a basic) one.

In my understanding, a shader is (usually) a short program written in a specific shader-language.
It's used to manipulate pixels and other low-level graphics objects just before they reach the screen.
You can layer and combine them with other shaders, on top of an the original textures and rendered pixels.

Yes, that's a gross and possibly imperfect oversimplification!
But I think I'll defer to [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader) and its references for a better overview.

I [adapted a basic an existing shader](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball/blob/main/src/menu/menu.gdshader) to have a starry background for the game.
And I'm confident I could do some more stuff with shaders myself now, if I want or need to.

#### Particles

This does what it says on the tin: it generates particles!
Think "fireworks" and "confetti".

A good friend tipped me to try and add some more things for the "feel" of the game.
Which is a great tip, and a good incentive to learn about particles.
So now there's now a little celebratory fireworks for achieving a medal score:

<video controls loop>
  <source src="/img/pincrediball-v1-20230326-particles.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  fireworks in the game
</video>

In the background you can also see the "Stars" shader in action.

#### Animations

Godot does animations with an `AnimationPlayer` (and a `Tree` for complex stuff) node.
My experience with Non-Linear Editing tools for video came in handy here.
Basically you create a little timeline, add a "track" per thing to animate.
Then tell it the "Key Frame" states, and Godot animates between those states.

I only used it for simple fade in- and out animations so far, for example for the splash screen.
But it can do far more complex stuff, prime example being animation of physics objects (e.g. a "walking" animation).
Which (I fear) can easily slurp up a lot of time.

By the way, many things you see "animate" (move) in the game currently are _not_ animations.
They fall under a different category, up next.

#### Audio

The tip to add audio sooner rather than later was gold.
Because with some generated and royalty-free sounds you can go a long way.
And Godot makes it rather easy to just have code play a sound or two at the right time.

Apart from the very basics, I have not touched any of the advanced stuff.
I know there's things like spatial audio, sound effects, and many more.
But I left those out of scope for this project.
So not much more to say here.

#### Physics

In a game engine like Godot, two things go hand in hand: graphics and physics.
Any game object with physics or collision properties takes part in a simulated 2D or 3D world.
A tiny "delta" of a few milliseconds is taken each "step" to estimate the next state of the world.
After that the graphics are updated to reflect that.

There's a _million_ things to properly arrange and set to create interesting games.
Including:

- **Physics properties**, such as gravity, friction, mass, inertia, torque, and many more.
- **Collision details**, like the collision shapes of things as well as layers (which things can collide with each other)

It's incredibly easy to get started.
And it's incredibly tough to debug and tweak.

### Web Development Overlap

Second, there are a few things that have overlap with building web apps.
Things you also need to master (at least a bit) and work out in a game.
A quick list.

#### Language

For Godot you _can_ choose C#, a language I know well.
But nearly _all_ examples and knowledge online uses GDScript, so I stuck with that.
GDScript is Godot's Python-like scripting language.
Easy enough to pick up if you know a little Python or other languages.
But certainly rough around the edges, and annoying to use at times.

#### Data

This feels like a really underdeveloped area of (Godot) game development.
I _know_ big game studios _must_ be using the techniques we know from other fields.
But beginners will find tutorials suggesting spreadsheets, exports to CSV, and some duck typing after reading the data.
**Insanity!**
And it doesn't help that the main language (GDScript) doesn't know if it wants to be truly Object-Oriented, or not.

#### Data-Flow

With data-flow, it feels like only 1% of generic software development practices reach game development.
Many important patterns -with the exception of State Machines!- are nearly absent in tutorials and documentation.

Again, surely big studios and experts have solutions, right?
But beginners are left creating spaghetti and tightly coupled singletons.
And I found myself somewhere in between, implementing poor-man's versions of uni-directional data flows and message buses.

#### GUI Layout

Powerful and workable on one hand.
On the other hand, it reminds me of FrontPage, DreamWeaver, Java Swing, WinForms, as well as the tables-for-layout era of web development.
A _pain_ to use.
Worth a devlog (essentially a long rant) on its own.
But having _something_ like this at all was great; not sure how far I'd gotten without it.
So mixed feelings about this in the end.

#### Tooling

The main tool is the Godot editor.

The visual designer was extremely helpful as a beginner.
Frustrating at times (looking at you, Undo Feature!), but a smooth experience for the most part.

The script editor, (nonexistent) refactoring tools, file system-based project structure, and overall editing experience...
Well, let's say we're _spoiled_ as web developers.
The experience with Godot is "okay", but not nearly as good as when doing web development.

You _can_ use external editors and tooling (like VSCode or Visual Studio), but that felt firmly outside of a beginner's scope.

#### Debugging

Ugh.

Okay, I guess I'm grateful we have _something_.
Break points mostly work.
Inspectors largely work, and there's always `print` statements, right?
Plus, shout out to the option to show collision shapes in a game: super helpful!

But it's absolutely no match for the debug tools we get in modern browsers.
Or the experience in -say- Visual Studio or JetBrains tooling.
Many times with Godot I found myself just going through and changing _all_ properties of an object, until I hit the right one.

But quite possibly this one's on me, for not learning the tools properly before using them?

#### Version Control

Basically the same as in web development.
It's great that most assets are text based files.
So git does the trick.

For larger games you probably need a better solution for binary assets such as art and sound?
But for small projects I think throwing them (neatly) in your repository works well enough.

### In summary

Game Development made me investigate _new_ tools and techniques.
Things I didn't know much about at all from web development.
I touched the basics of **Shaders, Particles, Animations, Audio, and Physics**.
And there are many more things to learn about as well.
**A great experience to try my hand at these things!**

Game Development also showed _overlap_ with Web Development.
I often felt underwhelmed and disappointed here.
It still eludes me how to do proper **architecture, data (flow), layout work, tooling, and debugging** in Game Development.
But really, **I expect this largely to be due to my own lack of research and learning**.

I suppose this post has become a (technical) summary of the entire project.
Which is great, because that leaves one less thing to procrastinate with next week.
When I should really _finish_ the project.
