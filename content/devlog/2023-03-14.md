## Day 30: Work In Progress

**_Jeroen_, March 14, 2023**

[Yesterday](#post-2023-03-13) I started the day with a devlog.
It outlined the goals and plan for this current stretch.
Since the end of yesterday you can now publicly track progress [on the GitHub Kanban Board](https://github.com/orgs/pincrediball/projects/1/views/1).

Today I'm building the foundations of the final codebase, using `prototype-007` as a reference point.
Which involves a ton of struggling with Godot's haphazard UI layout features.
So there's little time for an extended devlog.
These few paragraphs will have to do, dear reader!

Catch you tomorrow!
I'm off to get a wee bit more productivity out of today.
