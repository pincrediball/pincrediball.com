## Day 3: Website first?

**_Jeroen_, February 15, 2023**

Continuing from day 2 with a focus on _fun_ activities, I decided to finish up the website.
This time I don't think I can claim anymore that it's in the end somehow part of the _critical path_ though?

But regardless of whether it was _The Right Thing_ to do right now, it _was_ very effective!
I mean: you're looking at the very result right now.

The website was built with SvelteKit and TailwindCSS, which was rather efficient because I recently used it for both of my other recent side-projects:
[Tierdom](https://tierdom.jeroenheijmans.nl) and [vesta.infi.nl](https://vesta.infi.nl).
But not before I spent the entire morning learning some more Figma skills to do the entire design first.

I only bought the domain name, used
[GitHub pages with a custom and apex domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages#using-an-apex-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)
for hosting the whole thing.
Which, after the usual DNS hassle, works quite well!

All this means three important things:

- I can _comfortably share_ the plans with the world
- I am _on schedule_ for week 1's plans
- I have _no excuses left_ to procrastinate prototyping

So let's end this third day with some initial social media posts and links to this website.

**And tomorrow: we prototype!**
