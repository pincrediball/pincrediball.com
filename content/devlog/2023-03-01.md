## Day 17: Giving up

### **Jeroen**, March 01, 2023

I'm giving up.

The past few days have been extremely frustrating.
I'm spending _days_ on trivial things like [making objects only movable by a player](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/204691/how-to-make-object-movable-only-by-the-player).
In those days I'm also loosing _hours_ on how utterly inconsistent and unpredictable the Phaser and Matter API are for nontrivial things.

Summarizing those two things differently:

1. Core Pincrediball concepts are nontrivial in Phaser's physics engine;
2. Phaser itself and its engine are frustrating to work with so far;

So I'm giving up.
On my current approach.

#### What now then?

Well, I need to mentally reset.
So tomorrow I'll start with a completely fresh approach.
Not sure which yet.

To end this day with a brainstorm of a few possible roads to take:

- **Stick with Phaser and MatterJS?**
  Still try to stay with Phaser, revitalize, and try to make Matter physics work for me?
  Probably I should know better, given how frustrated I am right now.
- **Stick with Phaser and a new Physics engine?**
  Stay with Phaser, but see if there's a way to get **Box2D** to work with it?
  I found [the Pinball(!) example](http://phaser.io/examples/v2/box2d/pinball) but it was for the years old version 2 of Phaser.
- **Try out Godot, or Unity?**
  The main alternatives I'd consider (next to very maybe GameMaker).
  I'm just super-worried that I first need a few weeks to learn them.
- **Rolling my own engine?**
  This seemed like a bad idea [after day 10](#post-2023-02-22).
  But perhaps I should give it another go?
- **Quit building, start (more) procrastination?**
  To be honest, I've been enjoying everything _except_ building the damn game a lot.
  The website, the socials, the designs, the (not-yet-existent) Kickstarter...
  Perhaps I should embrace those first?
- **Quit altogether?**
  I have 4 out of 8 weeks left in my mini-sabbatical.
  There's plenty of things to do in those weeks, other than building a game.

And surely there are more options.
I'll sleep on it, and decide when I'm fresh at it again.
It's not very likely that I'll "Quit altogether", but I'm keeping options open:
first and foremost I want to be having fun.
And, surprise: all through abovementioned frustration, I'm still having fun!

But for now, I need a break.
