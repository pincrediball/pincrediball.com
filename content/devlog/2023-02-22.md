## Day 10: Prototype 003, part 2

**_Jeroen_, February 22, 2023**

Well... that was a disaster!

As warned by folks around me, and just as I already sortof knew would happen:
_rolling your own_ (engine) is a bad idea.
Generally.
And specifically, too (at least for this case).

After a few hours of labor here's where I got:

<video controls loop>
  <source src="/img/pincrediball-prototype-003.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Video recording of an extremely crude demo pinball machine.
</video>

And then the mountain of work became visible.

The smart thing to do?
Enjoy a few other fun things in my sabbatical, let the project lie down for a bit.
I'll likely revitalize my enthusiasm for the project and go back to using an existing engine.
Possibly within this web app that's now set up.

Stay tuned for prototype _004_ soon (?).
I'm calling it an early day, on Day 10.
