## Day 16: Putting it all together

### **Jeroen**, February 28, 2023

Second day of week 3, and although I _am_ pushing myself through _some_ relevant work, I'm not making the progress I wanted.

Heck, I'm even writing this recap at the start of day 16.
So I'm keeping it short, so I can try once more to get some work in.

What I did yesterday is to commit on a setup.
I did not name my repository for the day `prototype-...`.
No, I actually started the main game repository.
And I merged the best bits from earlier prototype.

That means the day after this one, there are really no excuses left.
Work has to be done on the game.
Let's get cracking!

PS. When I procrastinate I try to
watch [great Phaser tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@ourcadetv)
or [Real Life Pinball Machine Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMPyTqiot4)
(yes, that's a thing...). You might enjoy those too?
