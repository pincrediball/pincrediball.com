## Day 22: Prototype 007 (XXL devlog)

**_Jeroen_, March 06, 2023**

Fresh week, fresh energy.
Started the week by [committing "publicly" (on Mastodon) to three small goals for today](https://mastodon.social/@jeroenheijmans/109975463331122581):

> 1. Design the tutorial machine with initial art
> 2. Put the design into Godot
> 3. Allow plunging a single ball through it

Additionally (to "publicly stating goals") I'm also going to get all other productivity tricks that work for me going.
One of which is "writing my way through it".
That is: **I'm going to rubber duck by writing an _extra long devlog_** to keep me going.

âš  If you're here for more casual devlogs, **then I recommend to stop reading after his paragraph**.

...

If you're here for the full stream-of-consciousness, then saddle in! We're about to dive deep.

### 1. Designing the tutorial machine

Designing Pinball machines is a skill on its own.
I have no such skill, but I've tried to do a base level of research.
Amongst others, having checked [several PAPAPinball YouTube "Machine Tutorials"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSw7fK6x1mw&list=PL-WQLGFMr97CQpOQDEvRqAiSqcvSuK11h&index=3)
I see several aspects of a good Pinball machine:

- **Theme** that's appealing (often tied to an existing brand, like "Batman" or "Jurassic Park");
- **Backplate** with artwork around the theme;
- **Quests**: hitting specific targets in specific orders, in a way that's also fun and challenging;
- **Toys** are extra-special (often gimicky and theme-related) components of the machine that do something crazy when hit;
- **Balance** between how hard goals are to hit (and how big a chance you have to drain the ball), and how many points they give;
- [**Flipper tricks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_7TQ6wRZdw&list=PL-WQLGFMr97DnxeE1Rmi-wAwa-Vm7D-7i) should allow skilled players to be better at the game;
- **Multi-ball** mode is usually a goal to work towards, preferably when **"multipliers"** are enabled;
- **Basic components** that _must_ be included:
  plunger (with plunger lane and a gate),
  flippers,
  balls,
  lanes,
  spinners,
  bumpers,
  drop targets,
  slingshots,
  and rollovers.
- **Extra components** should probably also be included:
  backbox and display,
  outlanes,
  ramps,
  gates,
  and kickbacks.
- **Skill Shots** (plunging the initial ball at a particular speed to hit a particular target) are perfect for Pincrediball too.
  Especially in the tutorial levels, the "Playbook" could contain a precise skill shot.
  This makes it super fun to place the initial components in a very precise location.

We'll start with designing the theme, backplate, and quests.
One theme per "stage" of the game, so multiple levels are on the same theme.
The _Tutorial_ stage is up first.
Although I don't have a good term or word for the theme yet, it'll revolve around:

- Stick figures and a "math" paper background;
- A limited color scheme with shades of blue, and some black and white;
- Quests to build up a mini-comic lit up on the backplate;

At this point I'll stop writing out my thoughts on this blog post.
It's time to grab a tool to design the initial art!

This gives me something to work with!
Interesting notes about the design:

- The plunger lane includes an amber-colored gate that should be "one-way" for the ball;
- The three gates at the top are for points, and to be placed by the player in the game to create high scores;
- There's a tiny start for stick-figure art in the main area, which will indicate quest progress;
- I'm a noob at Figma, yet still made it work decently well!

I want to continue tweaking this design, but I _must_ move on.
There's still two goals left for today.
Time for a quick break, and then on to the next part.

### 2. Putting it into Godot

For some reason I figured that having SVG's in Figma would make it easy to import everything into Godot.
I was half right.
The _wrong_ half.

Importing the "Art" as textures was very easy.

But the important half was not so easy; perhaps more research is needed?
I was hoping the SVG paths would be useful as collision shapes.
Especially the bezier curves seemed logical for a pinball machine.
I set myself certain goals for today, and getting this bit perfect would hold me back.

So, I went the labor-intensive route.
Importing the design of the machine in chunks from Figma.
And after that... _manually tracing over those shapes again_, to create the collision polygons.
So...

That at least should work to some degree!
Let's have a look, shall we?

### 3. Allow plunging a ball

Time to program a little bit of interactivity.
The plan was as follows:

- A "Plunge" button that spawns a ball and shoots it into the field;
- **Bonus:** Flippers that just constantly, well, flipper;

After a bunch of trial and error;
after a ton of Godot 3.x to 4.0 translation;
after loads of debugging and tweaking;
in short after...

I have a ton of concerns still.
Most notably if this will be deterministic enough for my core game idea.
But concerns be damned, **I'm pretty content with this result!**

### Recap

In short, I achieved what I set out to do:
(1) design a machine, (2) put it in Godot, and (3) have basic ball physics.
Setting the goals at the start certainly helped.
Tomorrow I might go for a more free-form day, but soon after I'll certainly use this same trick again.

If you made it this far into my stream-of-consciousness post:
I salute you!
You're the best.

On to the next bits!
