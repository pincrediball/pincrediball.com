## Day 22: Rubber Ducking with y'all

### **Jeroen**, March 06, 2023

Fresh week, fresh energy.
Started the week by [committing "publicly" (on Mastodon) to three small goals for today](https://mastodon.social/@jeroenheijmans/109975463331122581):

> 1. Design the tutorial machine with initial art
> 2. Put the design into Godot
> 3. Allow plunging a single ball through it

Additionally (to "publicly stating goals") I'm also going to get all other productivity tricks that work for me going.
One of which is "writing my way through it".
That is: **I'm going to rubber duck by writing an _extra long devlog_** to keep me going.

âš  If you're here for more casual develogs, **then I recommend to stop reading after his paragraph**.

If you're here for the full stream-of-consciousness, then saddle in! We're about to dive deep.

#### 1. Designing the tutorial machine

Designing Pinball machines is a skill on its own.
I have no such skill, but I've tried to do a base level of research.
Amongst others, having checked [several PAPAPinball YouTube "Machine Tutorials"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSw7fK6x1mw&list=PL-WQLGFMr97CQpOQDEvRqAiSqcvSuK11h&index=3)
I see several aspects of a good Pinball machine:

- **Theme** that's appealing (often tied to an existing brand, like "Batman" or "Jurassic Park");
- **Backplate** with artwork around the theme;
- **Quests**: hitting specific targets in specific orders, in a way that's also fun and challenging;
- **Toys** are extra-special (often gimicky and theme-related) components of the machine that do something crazy when hit;
- **Balance** between how hard goals are to hit (and how big a chance you have to drain the ball), and how many points they give;
- [**Flipper tricks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_7TQ6wRZdw&list=PL-WQLGFMr97DnxeE1Rmi-wAwa-Vm7D-7i) should allow skilled players to be better at the game;
- **Multi-ball** mode is usually a goal to work towards, preferably when **"multipliers"** are enabled;
- **Basic components** that _must_ be included:
  plunger (with plunger lane and a gate),
  flippers,
  balls,
  lanes,
  spinners,
  bumpers,
  drop targets,
  slingshots,
  and rollovers.
- **Extra components** should probably also be included:
  backbox and display,
  outlanes,
  ramps,
  gates,
  and kickbacks.
- **Skill Shots** (plunging the initial ball at a particular speed to hit a particular target) are perfect for Pincrediball too.
  Especially in the tutorial levels, the "Playbook" could contain a precise skill shot.
  This makes it super fun to place the initial components in a very precise location.

We'll start with designing the theme, backplate, and quests.
One theme per "stage" of the game, so multiple levels are on the same theme.
The _Tutorial_ stage is up first.
Although I don't have a good term or word for the theme yet, it'll revolve around:

- Stick figures and a "math" paper background;
- A limited color scheme with shades of blue, and some black and white;
- Quests to build up a mini-comic lit up on the backplate;

At this point I'll stop writing out my thoughts on this blogpost.
It's time to grab a tool to design the initial art!

_...a few ~moments~ hours later_:

This gives me something to work with!
Interesting notes about the design:

- The plunger lane includes an amber-colored gate that should be "one-way" for the ball;
- The three gates at the top are for points, and to be placed by the player in the game to create high scores;
- There's a tiny start for stick-figure art in the main area, which will indicate quest progress;
- I'm a noob at Figma, yet still made it work decently well!

I want to continue tweaking this design, but I _must_ move on.
There's still two goals left for today.
Time for a quick break, and then on to the next part.

#### 2. Putting it into Godot

...

#### Addendum: parked ideas

One final productivity trick that works for me:
creating an official place to park ideas.
Just to prevent getting side tracked.

So here's a big list of ideas that came up today:

- **Ideas for Pincrediball.com**
  - **Dynamic header levels in Markdown**.
    The blog posts _should_ have a `h1` level title.
    This way if I ever create individual blog post pages they'll neatly get a `h1`.
    And for `/devlog` where all posts sit on one page, they can be dynamically changed.
    (The markdown plugin allows for overriding the header rendering methods.)
  - **Improve headers setup**.
    Additionally, the headers need tweaking.
    First, the author + date line doesn't need to be a header.
    It can be just an emphasized paragraph.
    That way all subsequent headers can be bumped one level.
    Which makes more sense and is thus good for accessibility.
    Additionally, the `prose` styles will turn out nicer.
  - **Bookmark organization**.
    All my researched bookmarks are in one big dumping folder.
    At the least I should organize them so I can find stuff more easily.
    In addition it might be fun to move the interesting ones straight onto the website.
  - **Terminology infographic**.
    It was hard to find a good visual aid for all Pinball terms.
    Creating one myself would be fun and useful.
- **Chase SvelteHack organizers**.
  Emailed the organizers of [hack.sveltesociety.dev](https://hack.sveltesociety.dev/) a while ago.
  Asked if my projects would qualify, since some light work was done _before_ the official start date.
  Never got a reply, so might be nice to chase that?
  (Although if I go with Godot, the game might be less integrated with the website than what'd be nice for the hackathon.)

All those ideas needed to be parked in favor of the three main goals.
