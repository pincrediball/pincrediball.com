## Day 22: Focus mode

### **Jeroen**, March 06, 2023

Fresh week, fresh energy.
Started the week by [committing "publicly" (on Mastodon) to three small goals for today](https://mastodon.social/@jeroenheijmans/109975463331122581):

> 1. Design the tutorial machine with initial art
> 2. Put the design into Godot
> 3. Allow plunging a single ball through it

Additionally (to "publicly stating goals") I'm also going to get all other productivity tricks that work for me going.
One of which is "writing my way through it".
That is: **I'm going to rubber duck by writing an _extra long devlog_** to keep me going.

If you're here for small bits, **then I recommend to stop reading after his paragraph**.
If you're here for the full stream-of-consciousness, then saddle in!

#### Designing the tutorial machine

...

#### Addendum: parked ideas

One final productivity trick that works for me:
creating an official place to park ideas.
Just to prevent getting side tracked.

So here's a big list of ideas that came up today:

- **Ideas for Pincrediball.com**
  - **Dynamic header levels in Markdown**.
    The blog posts _should_ have a `h1` level title.
    This way if I ever create individual blog post pages they'll neatly get a `h1`.
    And for `/devlog` where all posts sit on one page, they can be dynamically changed.
    (The markdown plugin allows for overriding the header rendering methods.)

All those ideas needed to be parked in favor of the three main goals.
