## Day 47: Home stretch! (DEMO RELEASE!!)

**_Jeroen_, March 31, 2023**

On budget and (<em>tightly</em>) on schedule I end the final day of my sabbatical project... with a DEMO Release!!
There will be one or more epilogue devlogs of a bit more length.
But for now:

---

ðŸ‘‰ **[Play and/or download the game at pincrediball.itch.io/pincrediball now!](https://pincrediball.itch.io/pincrediball)** ðŸ‘ˆ

---

**Linux and Windows** are supported, both in-browser and (higher quality) downloads for desktop.
Android devices... are not _officially_ supported, but if you try real hard you might be able to complete the tutorial.

**Sorry Apple users**.... web builds are broken in Godot for all Apple platforms, and an Apple desktop build will take me some more time.
I'm extremely sad about that, but not much I can do at this immediate point.

Oh, and there's a launch trailer too (opens in fresh tab):

Many thanks by the way to everyone who supported the project.
My friends on Slack and otherwise, testing and giving feedback and whatnot.
My colleagues and social media buddies, for the encouragement and interaction.
The community and open source authors making the tools I used.
And above all my wife, for, well... everything!

Time to prep a launch-moment-photo to be inserted here:

And after that, I say: thank you.
And: happy gaming!!
