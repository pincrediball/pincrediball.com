## Day 25: Research

**_Jeroen_, March 09, 2023**

Dear reader: thank you!

Because if you're here, despite me not promoting this post, you must be a real fan!

[Yesterday](#post-2023-03-08) led to some very tangible success.
As foreshadowed at the end of that post, today will be a shorter day.
So I was planning to spend some time on **research, instead of development**.

My plans include:

- Structuring Research I've already done
- Organizing my own glossary
- Researching "The Competition" (other Pinball software and games)

Let's get to the results, shall we!?

### Structuring Research

I've already built up a long list of online resources I've used so far.
High time to put this into a better, version controlled format!

The main part of my saved research consists of... **bookmarks**!
Let's keep it simple for now, and just integrate the most interesting ones with this website.
So without any ado:

Find them all at [pincrediball.com/resources#bookmarks](/resources#bookmarks)!

### Pinball Glossary

In my research I've found several glossaries for Pinball.
None of them summarize things in a way that suit me.
So it makes sense to create my own.

Same holds here as for the "Research".
It makes the most sense (for now) to just add it to the website.
So, without any ado:

Find the glossary at [pincrediball.com/resources#glossary](/resources#glossary)!

### Researching "The Competition"

If there _are_ any direct competitors, I might as well check them out.
Most likely there _will_ be software to create (and possibly also play) Pinball machines, which I also want to check out.
If there's time I might check some more general Pinball games.

This item was _last_ in my list, for good reason.
It's super open-ended, and could take hours, but also days or weeks!

In fact, this goal I've missed for today.
I'll put it into the (forthcoming) blog post on all sorts of random ideas I still have.
But for now: there's not much more to say.

### Summarizing

Right.
Short days are short.
Shorter even than you'd think.
And I _really_ want to wrap up this post, _before_ I leave for social engagements.

Maybe I'll revisit this post and the linked resources later in the day.
But most likely... _this will be it_.
And tomorrow should be another day of actual _development_ work.

Until then!
