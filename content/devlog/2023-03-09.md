## Day 25: Research

### **Jeroen**, March 09, 2023

Dear reader: thank you!
Because if you're here, despite me not promoting this post, you must be a real fan!

[Yesterday](#post-2023-03-08) led to some very tangible success.
As foreshadowed at the end of that post, today will be a shorter day.
So I was planning to spend some time on **research, instead of development**.

My plans include:

- Structuring Research I've already done
- Organizing my own glossary
- Researching "The Competition" (other Pinball software and games)

Let's get to the results, shall we!?

#### Structuring Research

I've already built up a long list of online resources I've used so far.
High time to put this into a better, version controlled format!

TODO: Summarize new situation.

#### Pinball Glossary

In my research I've found several glossaries for Pinball.
None of them summarize things in a way that suit me.
So it makes sense to create my own.

TODO: Summarize results.

#### Researching "The Competition"

If there _are_ any direct competitors, I might as well check them out.
Most likely there _will_ be software to create (and possibly also play) Pinball machines, which I also want to check out.
If there's time I might check some more general Pinball games.

This item was _last_ in my list, for good reason.
It's super open-ended, and could take hours, but also days or weeks!

TODO: Summarize this research.

#### Summarizing

TODO: Write a summary for this post.
