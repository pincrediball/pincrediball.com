## Day 26: Drag Game

**_Jeroen_, March 10, 2023**

Today I started like [past Monday](#post-2023-03-06):
by [publicly stating my goals for the day](https://mastodon.social/@jeroenheijmans/109998383905771802).
Here's what I'm aiming for today:

> Three goals again today for @pincrediball development:
>
> 1. Learn Godot's Drag & Drop system
> 2. Allow players to move at least _some_ components around
> 3. Learn about Scene Composition in Godot
>
> Plus: leave a little bit of energy to do some work on Saturday.
> I really need to make some plan for the last few weeks available to finish an alpha version.

So technically that's _four_ goals, I suppose?
Although also technically I did parts of "1" already, as you can tell from [/resources#bookmarks--godot-game-engine](/resources#bookmarks--godot-game-engine).

I will allow myself (at least) one more day to "muddle around" in [`prototype-007` code](https://github.com/pincrediball/prototype-007).
After that I really should be thinking about a somewhat clean codebase for the target alpha release of the game.

For now, let me put down my writing hat, and take a few moments to work through those goals.

_A few ~moments~ hours later..._

### Drag and Drop

Whelp, that wasn't trivial.
And as I feared when I just switched to Godot, them introducing a new major version would provide some hurdles.
So [a tiny underscore issue](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/204808/drag-and-drop-differences-between-godot-3-and-4) cost me a good two hours.

But, even though a little less polished than I'd like, we do have some results:

So with a bare minimum, I think I made my Drag & Drop goals for today.
In the process I learned enough about Scenes and composing them to keep me rolling.

### Up Next

I'll call the above state today's check point.
Maybe I'll do a few small things tonight.
Possibly I'll do some work on Saturday.
But for now...

Signing off!
