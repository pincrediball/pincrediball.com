## Day 26: Drag Game

### **Jeroen**, March 10, 2023

Today I started like [past Monday](#post-2023-03-06):
by [publicly stating my goals for the day](https://mastodon.social/@jeroenheijmans/109998383905771802).
Here's what I'm aiming for today:

> Three goals again today for @pincrediball development:
>
> 1. Learn Godot's Drag & Drop system
> 2. Allow players to move at least _some_ components around
> 3. Learn about Scene Composition in Godot
>
> Plus: leave a little bit of energy to do some work on Saturday.
> I really need to make some plan for the last few weeks available to finish an alpha version.

So technically that's _four_ goals, I suppose?
Although also technically I did parts of "1" already, as you can tell from [/resources#godot-game-engine](/resources#godot-game-engine).

I will allow myself (at least) one more day to "muddle around" in [`prototype-007` code](https://github.com/pincrediball/prototype-007).
After that I really should be thinking about a somewhat clean codebase for the target alpha release of the game.

For now, let me put down my writing hat, and take a few moments to work through those goals.

_A few ~moments~ hours later..._

TODO: Write rest of the blog post.
