## Day 12: Combining Phaser and Svelte

### **Jeroen**, February 24, 2023

I'm back to integrating PhaserJS with the MatterJS physics engine, and Svelte.
The fourth prototype uses some of the domain entities from prototype-003.
And it includes a Phaser scene for the actual Pinball machine.

For lack of time (the weekend calls for other obligations) I'll just use a static screenshot for the blog:

The rest of today was spent on trying to make Matter more deterministic.
And in that process I got (again) a bit side tracked with [an energy conservation issue](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js/issues/256#issuecomment-1443680697) with MatterJS.

So we close off this week with far less results than I'd hoped.
For a large part because I procrastinated and let myself get side tracked though.
What all that does mean is that I need to re-evaluate my goals and approach next week.

What's super important is that the machine becomes more deterministic.
The whole "automata player" and game loop idea falls apart if different runs of the automata have different outcomes.
Either the setup needs to become (more) deterministic, or the game loop has to change.
Or my goals for the project need to change...

Got a weekend to chew on that though.
