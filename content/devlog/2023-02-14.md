## Day 2: Now we're getting somewhere!

### **Jeroen**, February 14, 2023

Second day I allowed myself to get side-tracked.
I decided that the best way to keep motivation high was by _doing essential things disguised as non-essential things_.
By this I mean I tried to incorporate essential things (work on the designs and game idea) into far less essential things (that were enjoyable to do).

First thing I did was to **redo the main game screen's design**.
For fun I've shared that on the (current, at the time of writing) [home page](/).
After that I took care of a bunch of other non-essential (but fun!) things:

- ✅ Logo &amp; Banner designed
- ✅ YouTube channel claimed
- ✅ Itch.io account claimed
- ✅ Socials set up
- ✅ SteamWorks application submitted (and $100 fee paid...)

It was a _fun_ day with this too, as you can tell from [my related toot](https://mastodon.social/@jeroenheijmans/109865321998439644).
And it really gave me a bunch of inspiration and energy to continue on!
