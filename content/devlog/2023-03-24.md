## Day 40: Dropping ...

**_Jeroen_, March 24, 2023**

After some more [R&D on input handling](https://github.com/jeroenheijmans/sample-godot-node2d-input-handling)
I merged a [big PR](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball/pull/45)
which finalizes a working version of **Drag and Drop**, and then some:

> ```none
> Fixes #14 (Drag and Drop)
> Fixes #39 (Credits)
> Fixes #38 (Options)
> Fixes #36 (Splash screen)
> Fixes #37 (Menu)
> Fixes #21 (Menu music, which is just the game music but that's fine for now!)
>
> See also #18 (Medals and Level progression, doing a little work for that already)
>
> Followed by #46 (Drop leading to overlaps)
> Followed by #47 (Rotation of components)
> ```

Quite satisfying, in many ways.
The PR itself was a hot mess of commits and different concerns being handled.
But in my defense I'll say that this is okay for a hobby project...
and it seems to be "The Way" for game development in general?

Anyways, let's end this week with a recap of where things stand.

### Current State

And as you by now know, I prefer to show that with a quick video:

TODO

I got a good friend (who also happens to be a very good game developer) to play the current version.
Quality of the game(play) aside for a moment, I think the game felt quite playable already.
Looking at him poke about, tweaking the machine, just to see what will happen next, was rewarding for sure!

The "Current State" also includes that I'm at the eve of the final week of this project.
So that brings us to what's up next.

### Final stretch

With the merged PR today I closed the [alpha-release milestone](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball/milestone/1?closed=1).
Next up is the [beta-release milestone](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball/milestone/2).
That includes (at the time of writing this) the following work:

- Medals and level progression
- Gates and Drop Target Banks
- Forces (gravity, friction, etc) tweaks
- Some content for YouTube and other socials
- Reserve itch.io and Steam Store page
- Some polish

There's one week left in my mini-sabbatical.
And... **this seems doable!**
Not _easy_ by any stretch of the imagination though.
It will require a lot of effort, for sure.

But **what I (currently) still lack in game development skills, I make up for with persistence and commitment**.
Building a _high quality_ game will be for some other time.
_Finishing any game_ is the name of the current game!

Let's see if I can make good on those claims next week?
