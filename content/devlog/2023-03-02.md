## Day 18: Prototype 006 with Godot

**_Jeroen_, March 02, 2023**

Today I followed advice from friends.
Godot got several more recommendations.
And right after I decided to take it for a spin, [Godot 4.0 was released](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-4-0-sets-sail/).

> After 3+ years of breaking and rebuilding from the ground up, a complete core overhaul and a full engine rewrite: **Welcome to the start of Godot 4!**

So that's both good and bad.
It's nice that I join in right when a boost in new modern features is released.

But as I suspected, it's less nice that we're now in a state of limbo.
Documentation has warnings all over the place that they might still be out of date.
Online examples are thoroughly broken.
All forum posts and Q&A online still uses the 3.x way of things.

But if I download the 3.x LTS version, I'm learning obsolete skills from the get go.
So Godot 4.0 it was.

### Prototype? Mini-game!

I named it "prototype 006" and might still put the code online as such.
But I mainly set out to just build a tiny game with Godot.

As a teenager I'd lie on my back in my room, endlessly tossing a small ball in the air.
The goal?
To get as close to the ceiling as possible, _without_ actually hitting it.

So I made it into a tiny Godot game.
Really wanted to make it playable in the browser, more on that in a second.
First, an example of what it looks like:

[![Animated gif of a ball bouncing in the air for score](/img/pincrediball-prototype-006.gif)](/img/pincrediball-prototype-006.gif)

You press `[SPACE]` or `[LEFT MOUSE BUTTON]` for 0 to 2000 milliseconds to send it flying up.
The higher you get, the more points you score.
If you hit the ceiling?
Zero points.

Actually fun to build.
Mostly without frustration.
Better than Phaser, certainly.
This is looking promising!

### Godot exports

The actual exporting to platforms is a bit more finnicky.
Android requires the SDK so I'm yet to try that.
iOS similarly likely needs special stuff.

The `.exe` Windows version was somehwat easy.
It includes the entire Godot engine though.
So my super-simple game becomes 45+ MB: not great.

The "html5" version is even worse.
The WASM file also clocks in at similar size.
But worse: it requires quite modern but certainly not ubiquitous Web Server headers.
The response from the Godot team was, understandably but frustratingly:
["This is a Web Server problem that Web Servers should fix"](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/69020#issuecomment-1324253401).

It seems that [support for needed headers](https://stackoverflow.com/q/68609682/419956) won't easily work on GitHub Pages.
So no runnable version of the game on this devlog for now.

### Now what?

It'd be really sad if my final game wouldn't run well in browsers.
Both a demo version on the website, as well as an itch.io version, would be problematic.
But I don't think I'll let that hold me back.
Tomorrow I'll sleep in, and at some point go back to toying with Godot.
Mainly because it was _fun_ to do so!
