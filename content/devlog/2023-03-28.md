## Day 44: Home stretch! ("Giving back")

**_Jeroen_, March 28, 2023**

I'll be coding a bunch today, it's [the home stretch](#post-2023-03-27) after all.
I'm on schedule, but it's a _tight_ schedule.
But that's not the topic of today's devlog...

### Giving back

As you might know or now realize: I'm not a game developer by trade.
Instead, I make a good living in web development.
Pincrediball has been an 8-week-vacation project.
And it's been made possible in part by other people who invest their free and own time in **Open Source** projects.

I could've spent my vacation in several other ways.
Prime candidates would've been:

- watching series all day (roughly 15 euro's per months); or
- playing a few AAA games (20ish euro's a pop at a discount); or
- reading all the books I still have in queue (50 euro's worth); or
- take an intensive Spanish course (100 euro's, I'd reckon).

So **I figured I donate some of that "saved" money to the Open Source projects that made Pincrediball possible**.
No heavy analysis here, I just went through my dependencies list and picked a few.

### Donations

Too many options to choose from, but something's better than nothing.

Some rationales for choosing these projects, with links if you want to donate too:

- ♥ [**Godot**](https://godotengine.org/donate/),
  (€40,-) because it is the main Pincrediball engine.
- ♥ [**Phaser**](https://phaser.io/community/donate),
  ($30,-) because I want to see it improve!
- ♥ [**Svelte**](https://opencollective.com/svelte),
  ($20,-) because it powers the website and was a joy to work with.
- ♥ [**Browserlist**](https://opencollective.com/browserslist),
  ($20,-) which I picked from `npm fund`, and which I probably often rely on.
- ♥ [**Prettier**](https://github.com/prettier/prettier?sponsor=1),
  ($20,-) which I picked from `npm fund`, because it sparks joy!
- ♥ [**Doctors without Borders** (NL)](https://www.artsenzondergrenzen.nl/doneer/doe-een-gift/),
  (€25,-) on behalf of the many different people who spent time to answer my questions of forums.

No heavy analysis (as I normally do with _everything_), just picked a few logical ones and went with it.

### Home stretch

That's really all for the devlog today.
No further Pincrediball content at all.
I'll be posting this one in a second, grab some more coffee, and get coding.
Whatever gets added will be rolled up into a future devlog!

Catch you in the next one.
