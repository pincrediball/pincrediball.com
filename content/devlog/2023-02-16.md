## Day 4: Engine's on!

**_Jeroen_, February 16, 2023**

Today it's time to figure out an engine to use.
I'm leaning heavily towards [PhaserJS](https://phaser.io/) (the main alternatives being Godot and Unity),
because it allows me to tap into my existing web development and JavaScript skills.

I'm mostly doing tutorials and reading documentation, so no exciting updates from today for the devlog.
That does give me a minute to share my rough "plan" I created earlier in the project.
Here it is:

[![Brainstorm overview divided in 6 sections: Design, Graphics/Art, Sound/Music, Game Loop/Engine, Polish, Publish](/img/v2023-02-14a-tipm-brainstorm.png)](/img/v2023-02-14a-tipm-brainstorm.png)

It started as a brainstorm, but it became a rough "plan".
Each of the six parts is roughly a time box of one week.
I'm starting with "Design" this week, but currently borrowing a bit from the next goal: "Game Loop / Engine".

Stuff's color coded too: the red stuff is Must-Haves, yellow Should-Haves, and green the Nice-to-Haves.

What do you think?
Too optimistic?
Probably.
But let's see how far we'll get, shall we?!
