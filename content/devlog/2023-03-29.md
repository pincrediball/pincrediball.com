## Day 45: Home stretch! ("Statistics!")

**_Jeroen_, March 29, 2023**

We're in the home stretch this week!
Today's post is all about project statistics!
The meta stuff, to build some tension towards the actual beta release!

### Project hours

I've not kept exact track of things, but I think I can guesstimate quite well where I spent my time.
Here's a breakdown of the hours I put into this project:

[![Statistics showing division of hours for the project over week 7 through week 13 of the year, with "Game programming, Godot" topping at 59 hours out of total 361 hours spent](/img/2023-03-29-hours-estimation.png)](/img/2023-03-29-hours-estimation.png)

Or in a more accessible table:

Obviously this contains a forecast for this week as well, and assumes I'll actually finish it this week.

An indication of my confidence levels: roughly 4 out of very 5 cells is probably ± 20% accurate.
The overall estimates per week as well as the grand total are near certainly ± 20% accurate as well.

Originally I had estimated I'd be able to do this project within 6 (instead of 7) weeks.
Had I chosen Godot initially I would've probably made that.
But I won't complain: I enjoyed myself nearly all the way through, and am pretty happy with this outcome!

### Code statistics

Second, let's look at some code statistics.
Here's a quick export of the current (nearly complete) [core game repository](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball) code statistics:

[![Statistics showing equal parts GDResource and GDScript lines of code across roughly two dozen files each, total 4351 lines of code in 66 files](/img/2023-03-29-code-statistics.png)](/img/2023-03-29-code-statistics.png)

Or in a more accessible table:

<div class="hidden sm:block">

| Language   | Files |  Code | Comment | Blank | Total |
| :--------- | ----: | ----: | ------: | ----: | ----: |
| GDResource |   144 | 5,025 |       7 | 1,223 | 6,255 |
| GDScript   |    32 | 1,104 |      15 |   480 | 1,599 |
| Properties |     1 |   437 |       0 |    20 |   457 |
| Markdown   |     2 |    46 |       0 |    12 |    58 |
| gdshader   |     1 |    23 |       3 |     5 |    31 |
| JSON       |     1 |    23 |       0 |     1 |    24 |

</div>

<div class="sm:hidden">

| Language   |  Code | Comment | Total |
| :--------- | ----: | ------: | ----: |
| GDResource | 5,025 |       7 | 6,255 |
| GDScript   | 1,104 |      15 | 1,599 |
| Properties |   437 |       0 |   457 |
| Markdown   |    46 |       0 |    58 |
| gdshader   |    23 |       3 |    31 |
| JSON       |    23 |       0 |    24 |

</div>

I'm actually quite relieved and happy that the lines of code for the game well exceeds the 1500 lines of markdown (plus 500 lines of svelte)
for the [pincrediball.com repository](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball.com).
Even though I'm still also proud of the extremely consistent blogging side of things!

Note that the above statistics do not include:

- The prototypes (Godot nor Phaser prototypes)
- The sample repositories I made to help myself and others
- The code I wrote for forums and online Q&A
- The code I threw away...

### Back to the game

So, is that _it_ then?
Will the above roughly be what entailed a fully featured beta-release, which will [earn me at least 1 euro](#day-29-planning--goals)!?
Well, today I made the first full-featured release candidates.
It works well on Windows, can be made to work on the Web (to a degree), and even worked on Linux!

A good friend went above and beyond testing this release on Linux.
Feedback included a ton of DM's, a dozen or more screen recordings, and some initial feedback:

> - I'd like to be able to mirror/flip some components;
> - Some physics bugs occur where the ball lies still when it shouldn't;
> - The "Run Playbook" feature should be more discoverable;
> - Can we move and rotate things at ones, please? (Is that even possible?);
> - Bumper-walls don't communicate they only bump on one side;
> - Missing a "true" full screen mode (or borderless maximized);

But also some positive feedback, or positive words of encouragement!
And regardless of which it is, it made me smile.

Plus, it gave me a little extra energy for this home stretch!
Two days left...
