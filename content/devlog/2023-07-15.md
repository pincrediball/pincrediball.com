## Day 105: Releasing on Steam

**_Jeroen_, July 15, 2023**

My last post was "Day 47" (March 31st).
Since then 58 days have past.
My sabbatical was over and I've been back to work and other hobbies.
However, I did still spend a ton of time on Pincrediball over those weeks.

### Hours needed to get onto Steam

Nearly all of that work went towards getting the game onto Steam.
I was hoping it was only a little more work than publishing on Itch.io.
Boy, was I _wrong_!!

In sunk [an estimated 361 hours of work](#post-2023-03-29) into the full game and release on Itch.io.
In addition to that **I estimate publishing on Steam cost about another 100 hours or so**.
That includes roughly 12 hours of work on creating and coding the Steam Achievements.

That's _insane_!

There's two factors to all this.
First, the back office for partners at Steam is... outdated, and not the most user friendly web app in the world.
Yes, that's an understatement.
Second, there is just a _ton_ of forms to complete.
Let's dive into that, shall we?!

### Stuff needed to release on Steam

Officially the Steam Partner features are under "Confidential".
I'm not actually allowed to share the actual pages of the partner dashboards.
But I surely I can get away with giving a broad overview of what's needed to release a game on Steam.
Or at least what was needed for Pincrediball.
So, without further ado...

**Here's a grand overview of all the things _I_ needed to do to release on Steam**:

#### Store and Library settings

- Basic Info
  - Name, Developer, Publisher, etc.
  - External links (about 8 options)
  - Social Media Links (4 hardcoded options)
  - Search Keywords, comma-separated

  - Thumbnail image

#### Steamworks settings

- Application
  - Name (yes, again)
  - Supported Operating Systems (yes, again)
  - Release date (yes, again)
- Steam Pipe
  - Depots (basically ZIP's with your game files, one per OS in my case)
  - Branch and Builds with Depots to be included
  - Packages that are linked to Depots
- Installation
  - Windows launch options
  - macOS launch options
  - Linux and Steam Deck launch options

  - Stats (11 total for Pincrediball)
  - Achievements (9 total for Pincrediball) with two images for each one
- Community
  - Official Community Group with custom icon image
- Beta keys
  - Custom request for beta keys

#### Additional stuff

Before even gettings started you need to:

- Fill out all Personal and Company details
- Complete an 8 step Tax form with personal identification

And finally, note a few special things:

- Reserve time to handle all feedback from the review process of your store listing
- You need to pay a "Steam Direct Fee" of $100 to create a new game at all on Steam (refunded if you exceed a certain amount of sales)
- Publishing a game is another 2-5 business days review process
- Reserve time to build scripts to publish the Depots using the Steam SDK

Wew, that's a _lot_ of stuff, isn't it?
And there's something else as well...

### GodotSteam

That's right!
You actually need to write _code_ in your game to support Steam.
There's three things I wanted to do when I started integration:

- Basic steam integration (screenshots, shift-tab, etc.)
- Statistics per player (for potential Leaderboards)
- Achievements!

Integrating the Steam SDK in your game would be a rather complicated programming task.
Fortunately there's [GodotSteam](https://godotsteam.com/):
an open source project to make it easy to integrate Steam into your Godot game.
And it was a breeze to use!
I extended my "[Giving back](#post-2023-03-28)" and donated $9,- (small bits help too, right?) to the project's core maintainer.

You can check out [the only _43_ lines of code](https://github.com/pincrediball/pincrediball/blob/main/src/steam/steam_facade.gd) needed to integrate Steam into Pincrediball.

### Available now!

I was extremely motivated to get my game onto Steam.
Good thing too, because it was no joke to get through all that's needed.

As a consumer, I find Steam to be a great platform.
The quality of games is of course a lot higher than on Itch.io.
In part, that's probably due to the heavy weight process behind it.
It's baffling how bad the UX of their backoffice is at times, but I appreciate how hard it is to maintain a service like Steam.

Regardless.... _I made it_!
The game has been out on Steam for a few days now.
It's in "Early Access" and free of charge.
Go [check Pincrediball out on store.steampowered.com](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2378150/Pincrediball/).

All that's left to do now is to write a good wrap-up of the entire project.
Maybe publish my work in a few other places.
And after that, I think I will "close" off this Pincrediball chapter.

What a ride it's been.
