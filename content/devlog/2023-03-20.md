## Day 36: Dragging my feat

### **Jeroen**, March 20, 2023

**Yikes!**
Only two weeks left to finish my [goals](#post-2023-03-13).
I've nicely stuck to the plan, and worked on Drag & Drop of Pinball components today.
Which brings me to say...

**Whelp!**
Doing drag and drop in Godot is not easy ~at all~.
The very first steps are trivial.
Many tutorials describe how it's done.
But the edges... are rough.
And when I get distracted, I get _distracted_;
and I'll write an entire sample of [how Drag & Drop could be done](https://github.com/jeroenheijmans/sample-godot-drag-drop-from-control-to-node2d).
Guess I'd summarize it with a...

**Grumble!**
A _satisfied_ "grumble" though, because I worked hard, I made progress, and learned new things.
But a "grumble" nonetheless, because tomorrow will be another full day of dragging this feature along.
Let's hope I'll get it done with one more day.
Or at the very least have fun while trying!
