## Day 5: Prototype 001

### **Jeroen**, February 17, 2023

Today was not a very productive day, mostly because I didn't spend too much time on the project.
Still, got to a very first prototype with a plunger and a ball, plus some physics:

  />
  <source src="/img/pincrediball-prototype-001.mp4" type="video/mp4" />

It seems the choice for PhaserJS with the MatterJS physics engine is "good enough" for my goals.
And I think I will just leave it to chance that I chose right, instead of heavily investigating other Game Engines.

That's it for day 5.
Weekend's up next, we'll see if I continue work, or whether the next update will come on Monday...
