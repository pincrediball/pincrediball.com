## Day 39: Dragging indeed...

**_Jeroen_, March 23, 2023**

Back to Drag & Drop today, indeed!
But only after a teensy tiny bit more side-work.

### Game Structure Improvements

The menu screens and all that are just so satisfying.
Rounding the project out as an actual game.
If even of dubious quality.

First up, we have some proper options.
Styling `CheckButton`s in Godot is again an absolute _pain_, and not fun work at all.
But I'd learned my lesson and switched to `TextureButtons` within minutes:

It ain't much, but it was an honest hour's work!
And I'm sure you will believe me when I say that a working "_Continue Game_" option is equally glorious!?

### Gameplay Improvements

Several things have been improved on the gameplay side as well:

- ✔ Scores now show the medals you achieve as you run a playbook
- ✔ Score targets are now data-driven, can be different per level
- ✔ Disabled scoring when running a "Stress Test" is now more clear
- ✔ Component unlocks has been prepared
- ✔ A "DEBUG" button allows you to skip to the last level and unlock all components

Just for something shiny to look at, here's all of that in action:

This also ain't much, but it was an honest day's work!

### Beta Release?

Yesterday I ended with a mention of the [Alpha Release](http://localhost:5173/devlog#day-38-productive-procrastination--alpha-release).
Guess today I can already even talk about a beta release.
Because if quality levels are negotiable, we can get to the fixed deadline and feature set sooner.
And looking at the [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/pincrediball/projects/1/views/1) we're pretty close, actually.

And that's a good thing, because I have one day plus one week left.
So let's reach a good milestone tomorrow, shall we?!
