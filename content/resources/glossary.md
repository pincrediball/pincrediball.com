## Pinball Glossary

This will be a Pinball glossary, with _only_ the terms that are relevant to Pincrediball.
It's by no means exhaustive, on purpose.

### üì¶ Machine Components

- **Pinball Machines** consist of a main "**Cabinet**" with the main **Playfield**, and a **Backbox** with usually a **Display** (which might be a **"DMD"** (**Dot-Matrix-Display**)).
- The **Plunger** is the device that sends the ball initially into play from the **Plunger (or "Shooter") Lane**.
- **Gates** allow the ball to go through them and register this (e.g. for points).
  They can be "one-way", for example at the end of the **Shooter Lane**.
- **Flippers** are the carrot-shaped pieces near the bottom of a Pinball Machine to hit the ball with.
- **Sling Shots** are the triangular shapes that give the ball a speed boost towards the opposite side when hit.
- **Bumpers** will "bump" the ball when hit, giving it extra speed.
  Typical types include "**Mushroom (circular) bumpers**", and **Rectangular or Pill-shaped bumpers**.
  A "**Dead**" or "**Passive**" bumper won't give the ball extra speed, but will register a hit (e.g. for points).
- **Drop Targets** are upright pieces that drop down the playfield when hit.
  They're often in groups of three or more, forming a **(Drop Target) "Bank"**.
- **Rails** (also "**Habitrail**" or "**Wireform**") are usually two or four metal wires that guide the ball along a specific path.
- **Kickback** is a launching device often placed in **Outlanes** which (when enabled) "kicks back" the ball into play.
- **Lanes** are like car lanes: long paths just wide enough for a ball to roll through.
  **Outlanes** are the lanes on the side of the machine that typically will **Drain** the ball.
- **Orbits** are usually lanes that go from one side, via the top of the playfield, all the way to the other side of the table.
- **Ramps** lead the ball up along the z-axis to an elevated lane or mini-playfield.
- **Rollover** (switches) are flat switches on the playfield that register when a ball rolls over it, perhaps in a specific direction.
- **Gobble Holes** (or "**Sinkholes**") swallow up a ball underneath the playfield (with further effects dependent on the specific machine).
- **Popper** (or "**Vertical Up-Kicker**") will "kick" the ball up along the z-axis, e.g. onto a **Habitrail**.
- **Spinners** are targets that spin rapidly when hit by a ball, racking up points for each spin.
- **Newton's Cradle** is usually a "**Captive Ball**", trapped in a small lane, when hit by the active ball will move along the lane for points.
- A **Toy** is any special unique component specific to the theme of a table, with special visual and game or quest effects.

### üîÄ Game Mechanics

- **Draining** a ball means it'll roll down to the **Trough** at the bottom, loosing that specific ball from play.
- **Tilting** happens when the machine is physically bumped to nudge the ball a bit.
  Tilting too much usually ends the game by temporarily disabling everything (including **Flippers**) on the machine.
- **Quests** are theme-specific targets to hit in special orders, to achieve bonus scores and multipliers.
- **Modes** are stages of the game where different targets mean different bits of **Quest** progression.
  They often come with changes in scoring for various targets.
- **Skill shots** usually means **Plunging** the ball with just the right amount of force to hit a specific target when the ball initially enters play.
- **Jackpot** is a big bonus for a particular shot, sometimes only available in a specific **mode**, during a stage of a **quest**, or during a **Multi-Ball**.
- **Multi-ball** is a mode where the game enters extra balls (beyond the usual single ball) into play, typically accompanied by bonus scoring for specific targets.
- A **Ball-lock** is when the machine allows "locking" the current ball (and providing a fresh active ball),
  so when enough balls are locked a **Multi-ball** may be started.
- **Ball Saver** can refer to a limited time period after **plunging**, in which a **drained** ball will freely be returned into play.
- **Ball Saver** can refer to a specific physical device between and just below the two flippers to bounce the ball back up and "save" it from **draining**.

### üñê Pinball Skills

- **Dead Bounce** means letting the ball purposely bounce of a flipper that's _not_ being activated, to loosely let it bounce to the other flipper.
- **Death Saves** are tilting the machine slightly when the ball is rolling through an **Outlane** to **Drain**, bumping it back up sneaking it back into play.
- **Live Catch** means activating a flipper to instantly catch the ball in the corner of that flipper.
- **Drop Catch** is similar to a **Live Catch** except you also _release_ the flipper downwards just when the ball hits, to give more control over the ball.
- **Post Pass** transfers the ball from one flipper to the other by bumping it slightly onto the **slingshot corner** to send it over to the other side.
- **Tap Pass** transfers the ball from one flipper to the other by tapping the flipper very lightly.
- **Flick Pass** means _slightly_ and shortly dropping the flipper while the ball is about to roll off it, to "flick" it over to the other flipper.
- **Cradling** means holding a ball in a permanently activated flipper.
- **Cradle Separation** is tapping the flipper to move one ball out of multiple (from a **multi-ball**) from the cradle over to the other flipper.
